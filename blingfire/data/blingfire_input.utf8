how-to enable and configure gpu scaling feature
article number: gpu-68
contentmain1
this article provides instructions on how to enable and configure gpu scaling using amd radeon settings and amd catalyst control center.
the content of this article is categorized into the following sections:
reasons to use gpu scaling
gpu scaling modes
accessing scaling mode in amd radeon settings
accessing scaling mode in amd catalyst™ control center
reasons to use gpu scaling
to maintain aspect ratio for older games and applications that still run in a 5:4 aspect ratio format on widescreen display devices
to stretch a 5:4 aspect ratio resolution on a widescreen monitor
to reproduce a non-native resolution pixel per pixel on the display
note : the gpu scaling feature requires the use of a digital connection (dvi, hdmi or displayport™) from the display to the amd graphics adapter.
gpu scaling modes
preserve aspect ratio/maintain aspect ratio:
expands the current image to the full size of the monitor while maintaining the aspect ratio of the image size.
for example, at a resolution of 1280x1024 (5:4 aspect ratio), the screen will have black bars on the left and right side.
full panel/scale image to full panel size:
expands the current image to the full size of the monitor for non-native resolutions.
for example, at a resolution of 1280x1024 (5:4 aspect ratio), the screen will stretch to fill the monitor.
this is the opposite effect of maintain aspect ratio.
note : this feature is not designed to fix the issue of black borders on hdtv.
to resolve black borders on hdtv, please refer to kb article: gpu-72 .
center/use centered timings:
turns off image scaling and centers the current image for non-native resolutions.
black bars may appear around the image.
for example, setting a 24" monitor (native resolution of 1920x1200) at a resolution of 1680x1050 (16:10 aspect ratio) or lower will place a black border around the monitor.
accessing scaling mode in amd radeon settings
right-click the desktop and select amd radeon settings from the menu
in amd radeon settings, select display
select gpu scaling and switch gpu scaling to on
select the desired scaling mode​
accessing scaling mode in amd catalyst™ control center
right-click the desktop and select the amd catalyst™ control center from the menu
expand my digital flat panels and from the menu and select properties (digital flat panel)
check enable gpu up-scaling and select the desired gpu scaling mode then click apply .

a solid does not take the form of the container; rather a solid maintains its own shape.
answer 2:
a solid doesn't "fill a container".
a person or a machine fills a container with a solid by placing/dumping the solid into a container.
the solid may or may not fit into the container exactly.

a bottle containing solid iodine rystals fills with a violet haze upon standing at room temperature?
when a bottle containing solid iodine crystals stands at room  temperature, it will form a violet haze which is iodine gas.
iodine  crystals go through sublimation when unde … rgoing heat.
the gas will  form back into iodine by placing the bottle in a cooler  temperature.

does a solid spread to fill its container?
no. solids have definite shape and mass.
liquids, however, do spread to take the shape of their container.
--- answer 2: the answer depends on the solid.
if you dumped a lar … ge solid metal cube into a truck, it would not "spread outward" to fill a container.
if you dumped small bbs (think bb gun bbs) into the same truck, the bbs would spread out & fill the container (if you poured enough of the bbs into the container to fill it).
both are solids, but one solid will not 'spread out' like the others.

why does solids and liquids have a fixed size while gases fill whatever container they are in?
a gas will always have the same mass, as it fills a container it's density lowers.
liquids are non- compressible, meaning their density are always the same, for example water' … s density is 1.0

why do solids and liquids have a fixed size but gases fill whatever container they are in?
because the in a gas the particles move around freely as they have no bonds at all, therefore they are their own 'self'.
solids, however do have bonds. very strong bonds. the … y have a regular pattern which is why they have the same density all around. they cannot move around freely and they cannot pour.
liquids, however, can pour and the particles do have bonds with each other. however these particles are weak-not strong enough to hold them and keep their shape stiff. but they can move around freely which is why they also have a fixed size aswell.

the primary function of the digestive system is to break down the food we eat into smaller parts so the body can use them to build and nourish cells and provide energy.
the digestive system is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus.
inside this tube is a lining called the mucosa.
in the mouth, stomach, and small intestine, the mucosa contains tiny glands that produce juices to help digest food.
two solid organs, the liver and the pancreas, produce digestive juices that reach the intestine through small tubes.
in addition, parts of other organ systems (for instance, nerves and blood vessels) play a major role in the digestive system.
when we eat things like bread, meat, and vegetables, they are not in a form the body can use as nourishment.
our food and drink must be changed into smaller molecules of nutrients before they can be absorbed into the blood and carried to cells throughout the body.
digestion is the process by which food and drink are broken down into their smallest parts so that the body can use them.
the purpose of the digestive system is to absorb water and nutrients from food and beverages to be used by other systems within the body.
the digestive system is also responsible for eliminating solid waste.

explain the function of the digestive system?
the function of the digestive system is to digest the ingested food.
it starts in the mouth with mastication when food is chewed and mixed with salivary juices to start the pr … ocess of digestion.
the food then goes to the stomach where it is mixed with gastric, pancreatic juices and bile to continue the process of digestion and then absorption of the digested food is done by the small and large bowels and the waste products are excreted as faeces

what is the function of mucus in the digestive system?
in the stomach, the stomach acid is there to digest protein.
your stomach, as is mucus, is made of protein.
so, your stomach produces mucus to sacrifice instead of the stomach … muscle/protein.
the mucus is continually being digested by the acid, but it is also continuously being produced at the same rate as its digestion.
the mucus also protects the inner lining of the digestive system against abrasive objects you may have eaten.
lubrication?
need i say more than that mucus is slippery so the food slides more easily.
which part of the digestive system has no digestive function?
the part of the digestive system that has no digestive function is  called the esophagus.
the esophagus is also known as the food pipe.

what body parts does your circulatory system include?
the heart and all the arteries and veins, and the lungs make up the circulatory system.
the heart pumps oxygenated blood around the body through the aorta, and deoxygenated bl … ood returns to the heart through the vena cava.
this is the systemic circuit.
at the lungs, small air sacs called alveoli allow oxygen to diffuse into the arteries before going to the heart, and then being pumped around the rest of the body.
this is the pulmonary circuit.

how does the endocrine system help maintain homeostasis?
through the release of hormones, which are chemicals released in one part of the body that travel through the bloodstream and affect the activities of cells in other parts of … the body.
these hormones bind to chemical receptors called 'target cells', and then the body is signaled to complete a task that ultimately helps maintain homeostasis.

how is homeostasis regulated by the endocrine system?
in order to answer this question we must all understand what the organs are that make up the endocrine system.
the hypothalamus is the master control found in the brain at the … base of the optic chiasm.
the hypothalamus releases a hormone in the pituitary gland, controls the blanace of water, sleep, temperature, appetite, blood pressure and such.
there is much more but that is a start.....
hormones!
homeostatic conditions also vary across the body - for example, a high acidic level must be maintained in the stomach, this level is maintained by the hormone gastrin, which is released when the stomach is stretched by food, this hormone targets the production of hcl (hydrochloric acid) in the stomach   another, possibly the most important homeostatic condition is water, which can be maintained by the hormone adh (anti-diuretic hormone) which controls how permeable the distal convoluted tubules and collecting tubules are, the increase of permeability makes the water that would usually go straight into the urine go back into the body, this lowers water loss and increases urine concentration. this hormone is only released when the body is dehydrated, but when the body has too much, this is removed from the body and most of the water that would be reabsorbed into the body is just removed in the urine.
hormones send messages to different organs and organ system to turn on/off speed up/slow down activities of those tissues         this is the main way we maintain homeostasis actually, since the endocrine system releases chemicals known as hormones.
these hormones are sent via the blood to specific spots in the body to control things like blood sugar, heart rate, etc.

what common household process if often compared to the way the endocrine system maintains homeostasis?
the common household process that is often compared to the way the endocrine system maintains homeostasis is a furnace thermostat on the wall of a house.
in a house a thermos … tat is set at a specific temperature.
when the temperature in the house falls below this designated temperature, the thermostat is triggered and signals the furnace to turn on and begin heating the house.
once the temperature of the house is above the designated temperature, the thermostat signals the furnace to turn off.
this process is called negative feedback.
the endocrine also works in a negative feedback system to maintain homeostasis.
an example of negative feedback in the endocrine system is the regulation of calcium levels.
parathyroid glands release parathyroid hormone (pth), which regulates the blood calcium levels.
if there is a decrease in blood calcium the parathyroid glands will secrete more pth.
then the pth stimulates the release of calcium from the bones into the bloodstream.
if blood calcium levels increase too much, the parathyroid glands will reduce their production of pth and less calcium will be released from the bones.

how is homeostasis maintained by the nervous system and endocrine system?
the nervous system has many different mechanisms that it uses to maintain homeostasis in terms of modulating incoming signals and the processing of those signals.
interconnect … ing neurons can upmodulate or downmodulate a signal through the release of various neurotransmitters that are excitatory (increase signal intensity) or inhibitory (decrease signal intensity).
in addition to this, more long-term mechanisms are those of upregulation and downregulation.
this involves many different chemical factors that cause the neuron to increase receptor density or function (making the nerve more sensitive to a signal) or decrease receptor density or function (making the nerve less sensitive to a signal).
the brain interacts with and controls the endocrine system through the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland in the brain.
the endocrine system has many different "master" hormones and secondary hormones that control functions throughout the body.
there are growth hormones that are turned on and off, sex hormones that regulate growth and reproductive function, and various other hormones that control bone density, water and salt balance, renal function, liver function, etc..
just like the nervous system, these are controlled by a feedback loop that tells the system whether a surplus or deficiency of a given signal or activity level is found in each system.

when did the new york stock exchange first open?
the origin of the nyse can be traced to may 17, 1792, when the buttonwood agreement was signed by 24 stock brokers outside of 68 wall street in new york under a buttonwood tre … e on wall street.
on march 8, 1817, the organization drafted a constitution and renamed itself the "new york stock & exchange board".
anthony stockholm was elected the exchange's first president (for other presidents, see list of presidents of the new york stock exchange).
the first central location of the exchange was a room, rented in 1817 for $200 a month, located at 40 wall street.
after that location was destroyed in the great fire of new york (1835), the exchange moved to a temporary headquarters.
in 1863, the new york stock & exchange board changed to its current name, the new york stock exchange.
in 1865, the exchange moved to 10-12 broad street.
the volume of stocks traded increased sixfold in the years between 1896 and 1901, and a larger space was required to conduct business in the expanding marketplace.[8]
eight new york city architects were invited to participate in a design competition for a new building; ultimately, the exchange selected the neoclassic design submitted by architect george b. post. demolition of the exchange building at 10 broad street, and adjacent buildings, started on may 10, 1901.
the new building, located at 18 broad street, cost $4 million and opened on april 22, 1903.
the trading floor, at 109 x 140 feet (33 x 42.5 m), was one of the largest volumes of space in the city at the time, and had a skylight set into a 72-foot (22 m)-high ceiling.
the main façade of the building features six tall corinthian capitals, topped by a marble sculpture by john quincy adams ward, called "integrity protecting the works of man".
the building was listed as a national historic landmark and added to the national register of historic places on june 2, 1978.[9]  
in 1922, a building for offices, designed by trowbridge & livingston, was added at 11 broad street, as well as a new trading floor called "the garage".
additional trading floor space was added in 1969 and 1988 (the "blue room") with the latest technology for information display and communication.
yet another trading floor was opened at 30 broad street in 2000.
as the nyse introduced its hybrid market, a greater proportion of trading came to be executed electronically, and due to the resulting reduction in demand for trading floor space, the nyse decided to close the 30 broad street trading room in early 2006.
as the adoption of electronic trading continued to reduce the number of traders and employees on the floor, in late 2007, the nyse closed the rooms created by the 1969 and 1988 expansions.
the stock exchange luncheon club was situated on the seventh floor from 1898 until its closure in 2006. [10]  
the floor of the new york stock exchange in 1908   the nyse announced its plans to acquire archipelago on april 21, 2005, in a deal intended to reorganize the nyse as a publicly traded company.
nyse's governing board voted to acquire rival archipelago on december 6, 2005, and become a for-profit, public company.
it began trading under the name nyse group on march 8, 2006.
a little over one year later, on april 4, 2007, the nyse group completed its merger with euronext, the european combined stock market, thus forming the nyse euronext, the first transatlantic stock exchange.
presently, marsh carter is chairman of the new york stock exchange, having succeeded john s. reed and the ceo is duncan niederauer, having succeeded john thain.

what were the committees of correspondence?
the committees of correspondence were bodies organized bythe local colonial leaders of the thirteen colonies before andduring the american revolution for the purposes of coo … rdinatingwritten communication between separate cities and colonies.
theseserved an important role in the revolution, by disseminating thecolonial interpretation of british actions between the colonies andto foreign governments.
the committees of correspondence ralliedopposition on common causes and established plans for collectiveaction, and so the group of committees was the beginning of whatlater became a formal political union among the colonies.
as news during this period was typically spread in hand-writtenletters to be carried by couriers on horseback or aboard ships, thecommittees were responsible for ensuring that this news accuratelyreflected the views of their parent governmental body on aparticular issue, and was dispatched to the proper groups.
manycorrespondents were also members of the colonial legislativeassemblies, and were active in the secret sons of libertyorganizations.
--- on march 17, 1772 an organization called the committee ofcorrespondence was formed by samuel adams to protest against thebritish and it helped the american revolution form.
the committeetalked about problems they had with the british and how they couldconfront these problems.
samuel adams asked other cities and townsto do the same.
the committees wrote letters to one another to tellhow they were protesting in each towns and city.
the letters weredelivered on horseback between towns.
the king banned thesecommittee but they kept on sending letters anyway.
committees of correspondence is the shadow of the governments isorganized by the patriot leaders.
this is in the thirteen colonies.

earlier informal committees had appeared following the stamp act in 1764.
but the most notable of the committees of correspondence were bodies organized by the local governments of the thirteen colonies before and during the american revolution, for the purposes of sharing information between colonies.
these served an important role in the revolution, disseminating the colonial interpretation of british actions, and the actions taken in response.
they formed the nucleus of independent colonial legislatures.

what effect did the committees of correspondence have in the colonies?
the committees were among the first groups to represent a unified colonial government, rather than the separate assemblies that operated under british rule.
the colonies reali … zed that successful responses to british actions were made easier by cooperative efforts.

there are three kinds of answers: ones that are mostly right, ones that are mostly wrong, and those that once were right but now are wrong.
did the committees of correspondence anger the colonists?
it concerned the loyalists, who saw that many on the committees were moving toward rebellious acts.
but it was welcomed by those who had begun to resent british rule, as they … were able to coordinate their activities to promote the cause of independence.

what did the committees of correspondence do?
the committees of correspondence were secret us colonial groups that exchanged information regarding the actions of the british.
they started in 1772, prior to the revolutiona … ry war, and continued throughout the war.
by establishing coordination between the groups opposing the british, they represented an early form of a federal government.
as the american colonists became more and more unhappy with the king in england, they began to organize efforts to govern themselves.
these became known as "committees of correspondence", because at first their major efforts were to send letters telling their counterparts in other colonies what was going on in theirs, and to promulgate such letters so everyone would know what was happening.
in some cities, such as boston, they had local committees as well.
when war began and separation occurred, because most men on the committees were members of their colonial parliaments, and definitely the most informed, they effectively became the colonial governments in a number of colonies.
when independence was proclaimed, the committees surrendered their power to new colonial legislatures -- though since almost all of them were parts of those legislatures, the change of government was smooth.
loyalists were excluded from the committees, and thus from the new legislatures.

there are three kinds of answers: ones that are mostly right, ones that are mostly wrong, and those that once were right but now are wrong.
what was the importance of the committees of correspondence?
they coordinated activities among the american colonies in response to the increasingly authoritarian british rule.
this fostered a unity of purpose among the several colonies … , which had been deprived of much of their autonomy in the early 1770's.
this ultimately resulted in the first continental congress.
when war finally erupted in 1775, the committee members were among those who formed the new independent governments in the states.

who initiated the committee of correspondence?
samuel adams of boston initiated the first committee of correspondence in november 1772.
he, dr. joseph warren, james otis and over a dozen other patriot leaders asked the bo … ston town meeting to form an official committee in response to the most recent british offense, their wanting to send colonials to england for trial because they had attacked a british customs ship, the hms gaspée, that had been trying to enforce the unpopular new trade regulations.
the stated purpose of the boston committee of correspondence was to prepare a statement of the rights of the colonists, declare that these rights had been infringed by the british, and send a letter to all the towns of the province of massachusetts and "the world", most importantly the other colonies, to tell them of this.
the larger purpose of the committee of correspondence, though, was to create a system of spreading information about the latest offenses of the british government, to build support for their cause throughout the outlying towns of their own colony and in other colonies as well and to coordinate the responses of the colonists.
because there was no other way to spread news effectively, they wrote letters and pamphlets (the usual way to promote political issues at that time) and sent them out by postal rider or ship.

were the committees of correspondence good or bad?
for the loyalists and those that sought to maintain british rule in  the american colonies, they were very bad.
for the patriots who  shared a common goal of determining the … ir own destinies, they were  essential.
many of those who were active in the committees had come  to resent the rule of king george and the british parliament, and  they began to espouse american independence.

they communicated these in  documents that they sent to the other cities … and the other  colonies.

is emily in a rose for emily black?
no, while faulkner doesn't directly tell his readers that miss emily is white, her position as old southern aristocracy clearly makes her white.
note too that faulkner refers … to her servant as a "negro."
tellingly, he doesn't do this for emily.
if this question is bubbling around in your head after reading the story, a second reading would be a really good idea.
from a rose for emily who is miss emily?
she was a woman that the townspeople (narrator(s)/us) constantly watched go from a young woman to an elderly lady.
in the short story not much is learnt a … bout her later life as she spent most if not all of it inside her house and was only seen walking by a window at times.
one thing that is learned is that she killed homer baron and preserved his body in order to fulfill her duty of housewife, she was a monument of the old south therefore her primary duty in life was to secure her future and because of her relationship with her father, the only way to preserve her future was by preserving homer baron's body.

what is gothic lolita by emilie autumn about?
its about her, she was raped, like in her song "i only lived two or three" , that's when she was raped , when she was 2 or 3 and " i thank you kind sir, you've made me what i … am today, a bundle of broken nerves..."
this kind of goes back to the idea that she is dead now, after her rape- she bases her songs on murder , death, ect.
actually she was raped when she was 6.
but yes that's pretty much it.
she is, of course, being sarcastic when she says "thank you kind sirs".
and also (not that it is very important) my favorite line is when she says "i don't mind telling you, now that i'm old enough to love i couldn't begin to even if my pretty life depended on it.
and, funny thing, it does."
it says so much, like "if i could love it would make things a little better, sadly you took care of that. thanks, now i can't even do that."

attendance at iep meetings related to transition
student invite
students should be invited to their iep meetings.
a student who is 14 years old or older must be invited to the iep meeting where transition services will be discussed.
if the student chooses not to attend, efforts need to be made to relay the student's preferences to the iep team.
tip: to increase the likelihood of the student attending and participating in his or her own iep meeting, help the student prepare prior to the meeting.
for more information on student-led ieps refer to the youth development section of this website.
outside agency participation with prior consent
two important components to agency participation:
consent of the parent or the student must be received prior to inviting a participating agency
any participating agencies should be invited to the iep meeting
tip: to ensure outside agency participation, give ample notice of the meeting date and time.
tip: if the adult service agency representatives cannot attend, ask them to provide input prior to the meeting so that it can be considered by the whole team.
interagency collaboration
interagency collaboration prior to the student leaving high school can help to make connections that a student could not make on his or her own.
many parents and students are nervous to leave the support of the high school behind, partially because they don't know where to get support once the student is not in high school.
also, they are leaving the world of idea (entitlement) and moving into a world of eligibility (ada and section 504 of the rehab act).
high schools can help the student and family make connections to adult service agencies by inviting those agencies to iep meetings in the last two years that the student is in high school.
have the student and family get to the know the adult service representative that will be supporting them and, conversely, the adult service agency representative becomes more familiar with the student and family's support needs.
by having the adult service agencies at the iep table, a plan can be developed for a seamless transition as possible.

if the transformer has two separate windings, then, yes a step-down can be used as a step-up, and vice-versa.
it is more correct to say you are reversing the high and low sides.
by definition primary is the "in" side and secondary is the "out" side.
the primary could be the high voltage side if it is a step-down,
or it could be the low voltage side, if it is a step-up.
design considerations care must be taken when reversing the operation of a step-down transformer to insure that it does not exceed the ratings of the transformer.
for example, let's say we have a 12 va step-down transformer that takes 120vac in and is rated to provide 12v at 1 amp at the secondary.
if we were to reverse it and apply 12vac to the new primary (the old secondary), we would have 120vac at the new secondary, but to keep within the original ratings it could only be loaded to 0.1a @ 120vac.
as long as you treat the output rating of the step-down transformer as the input rating as a step-up transformer, and don't try to draw current beyond what would normally have been applied to the high voltage primary, you should be fine.
potentially one could push up the voltage on such a transformer beyond what its stated application specified, while making sure not to exceed the power rating of the transformer and not exceeding the breakdown voltage of the transformer's insulation, for example driving the above transformer at 24v to get 0.05a @ 240vac.
it is important to realize though that the rated input voltage for a step-down transformer will likely not be a safe input voltage if you use it as a step-up transformer - for example, applying 120v to the above transformer with the windings reversed would generate 1.2kv!
one important point to remember when reversing a three-phase transformer to a step-up is what kind of windings it has.
most three-phase transformers use a "delta" configuration on the primary side.
this means that there are three "hot wires" and a ground, but not a neutral.
(the white wire in a circuit).
on the secondary side, transformers are usually wired up in a "wye" (sometimes called a "star" configuration.
doing this allows the transformer to create a neutral connection.
if a step-down transformer is reversed to make it a step-up, the high (output) side will not have a neutral connection.
if one is not needed, say for a three-phase welding machine, this would not be a probem.
however, if a neutral is needed ,say for lighting, reversing this transformer would not work.
in this case, a listed step-up transformer will be needed.
one final thing, if a step-down transformer is used as a step-up, a neutral wire is not required to be connected to the input side.

do transformers step up voltage?
short answer yes they can.
longer answer. one of the main advantages of ac distribution of power is that you can easily change voltages up or down through the use of transfo … rmers.
this is true of single phase or 3 phase transformers. for example looking at the new zealand system, power is generated at 11kv at power stations, this is stepped up through transformers to either 110kv or 330kv for distribution as it allows the use of cheap aluminum cable in the runs as power loss i2r is reduced by the high voltage, low current distribution.
then it is reduced to 33kv and 11kv for local feeds arround town. finally local street transformers reduced the voltage to 400volt 3 phase and 230 volt single phase feeds for local supplies.
transformers that raise the voltage are called step up ransformers e.g. if i was to travel overseas, i would take a 100v- 230 step up transformer to allow me to use nz devices overseas (so long as frequency is not a concern) and to use usa appiances in nz is use a 230/110 volt step down transformer to reduce the voltage.

is it a step up or a step down a transformer has 20 primary windings and 100 secondary windings the secondary voltage is 25v?
if a transformer has 20 primary windings and 100 secondary windings, it is a step up transformer.
if the secondary voltage is 25v, the primary voltage will be 5v, because the … turns ratio is 20 to 100, or 1 to 5.

if a transformer has 20 primary windings and 100 secondare windings and the secondary voltage is 25 v find the primary voltage is this a step up or step down transformer?
it is a step up transformer since the secondary windings are greater than the primary. the turns ratio is (primary to secondary) 1:5, so the primary voltages is 1/5 of the sec … ondary (5 volts).

how do you step down voltage in transformers?
step up or stepdown is done by the ratio of the number of turns in the primary / secondary coil, large number on high voltage side small number on low voltage side. the wire u … sed on the low voltage side would be thicker than the high.

why current step down in voltage step up transformer?
in an ideal transformer, power in = power out example: the input voltage of 115vac @10amps is stepped up to 230vac, so what is the secondary current?
115 x 10 = 230 x i …
i = 115 x 10/230 i = .5 x 10 = 5 amps the current is stepped down to 5 amps from 10 amps  
what happen to voltage when a transformer is stepped up and stepped down?
a step up transformer increases the applied voltage.
a step down transformer decreases or lowers the applied voltage.
an example of step up transformers are the transformers …
(known as fly-backs) in old crts that stepped up voltage from 110 volts to 25,000 volts.
an example of step down transformers are the power bricks for laptops or any power adapter that step down the voltage from 110 volts to 12 volts, 9 volts or whatever is needed for your device.
i must add that most (not all) power adapters also convert ac to dc.

when transformer use in voltage step up?
step up transformers are used whenever you want to increase the magnitude of an a.c. voltage.
for example, the voltage produced by a generator at a power station is far too lo … w (11 - 25 kv) for the transmission of electrical energy, so a step-up transformer must be used to increase that voltage to transmission levels (e.g. up to 400 kv in the uk).

how does the relative number of turns on the primary and secondary coil in a transformer affect the step-up or step-down voltage factor?
let n1 be the number of turns at the primary winding and n2 the number of turns at the secondary winding.
define the ratio as n = n1 / n2.
n1 i1 = n2 i2, v1 / n1 = v2 / n … 2, that is n i1 = i2, v1 = n v2.
ie: say you have a transformer with 110v at the primary winding, n1=10 turns at the primary and n2=5 turns at the secondary. secondary winding will show 110v*5/10=55v.
physical reason is that you share and balance a unique induction flux between primary and secondary windings, that is flux = n1i1a transferred to the secondary: ... = n2i2a, where a is the single turn surface.
finally, you can derive voltage ratios from faraday's induction law: vk = nk d(flux) / dt.

why high voltage step down transformer uses delta as primary and wye connection as secondary?
because usually the step down transformers are used for supply so it requires neutral(return)path, we cant take neutral path through delta connection hence the star connection … is used and mostly in step-down the star connection is used.

what allows simple transformers to step voltage up or down-?
what allows it is the use of alternating current.
the simplest  transformer has two separate coils of wire on a magnetic core.
a  supply connected to the primary coil or win … ding causes an  alternating magnetic flux in the core, and this flux induces a  voltage in the secondary winding.
the output voltage is set by the  number of turns in the secondary winding.
the number of turns in each winding is set by the turns-per-volt  figure, which depends on the amount of magnetic flux, which in turn  depends on the size of the magnetic core.
a large core used in a  power transformer could have a turns-per-volt figure of less than  one, so it's measured in volts per turn.

the winning pitcher was san francisco's juan marichal, who pitched all 16 shutout innings.
the losing pitcher was milwaukee's warren spahn who had pitched 15.1 scoreless innings before yielding mays' home run.
almost nine years earlier, in august 1954, jack harshman of the chicago white sox pitched a 16-inning shutout against the detroit tigers.
al aber of detroit gave up the game's only run of the game in the 16th.
in game 7 of the 1991 world series, the minnesota twins and the atlanta braves played scoreless baseball before the twins won 1-0 sin the bottom of the 10th inning.

severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)
sars; respiratory failure - sars
share
severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) is a serious form of pneumonia .
it is caused by a virus that was first identified in 2003.
infection with the sars virus causes acute respiratory distress (severe breathing difficulty) and sometimes death.
the major features of the lungs include the bronchi, the bronchioles and the alveoli.
the alveoli are the microscopic blood vessel-lined sacks in which oxygen and carbon dioxide gas are exchanged.
air is breathed in through the nasal passageways, travels through the trachea and bronchi to the lungs.
causes
sars is caused by a member of the coronavirus family of viruses (the same family that can cause the common cold ).
it is believed the 2003 epidemic started when the virus spread from small mammals in china.
when someone with sars coughs or sneezes, infected droplets spray into the air.
you can catch the sars virus if you breathe in or touch these particles.
the sars virus may live on hands, tissues, and other surfaces for up to 6 hours in these droplets and up to 3 hours after the droplets have dried.
while the spread of droplets through close contact caused most of the early sars cases, sars might also spread by hands and other objects the droplets has touched.
airborne transmission is a real possibility in some cases.
live virus has even been found in the stool of people with sars, where it has been shown to live for up to 4 days.
the virus may be able to live for months or years when the temperature is below freezing.
with other coronaviruses, becoming infected and then getting sick again (reinfection) is common.
this may also be the case with sars.
symptoms usually occur about 2 to 10 days after coming in contact with the virus.
in some cases, sars started sooner or later after first contact.
people with active symptoms of illness are contagious.
but it is not known for how long a person may be contagious before or after symptoms appear.
symptoms
the main symptoms are:
cough
difficulty breathing
fever greater than 100.4°f (38.0°c)
other breathing symptoms
the most common symptoms are:
chills and shaking
cough, usually starts 2 to 3 days after other symptoms
fever
headache
muscle aches
less common symptoms include:
cough that produces phlegm (sputum)
diarrhea
dizziness
nausea and vomiting
runny nose
sore throat
in some people, the lung symptoms get worse during the second week of illness, even after the fever has stopped.
exams and tests
your health care provider may hear abnormal lung sounds while listening to your chest with a stethoscope.
in most people with sars, a chest x-ray or chest ct show pneumonia, which is typical with sars.
tests used to diagnose sars might include:
arterial blood tests
blood clotting tests
blood chemistry tests
chest x-ray or chest ct scan
complete blood count (cbc)
tests used to quickly identify the virus that causes sars include:
antibody tests for sars
direct isolation of the sars virus
rapid polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test for sars virus
all current tests have some limitations.
they may not be able to easily identify a sars case during the first week of the illness, when it is most important.
treatment
people who are thought to have sars should be checked right away by a provider.
if they are suspected of having sars, they should be kept isolated in the hospital.
treatment may include:
antibiotics to treat bacteria that cause pneumonia (until bacterial pneumonia is ruled out or if there is bacterial pneumonia in addition to sars)
antiviral medicines (although how well they work for sars is unknown)
high doses of steroids to reduce swelling in the lungs (it is not known how well they work)
oxygen, breathing support (mechanical ventilation), or chest therapy
in some serious cases, the liquid part of blood from people who have already recovered from sars has been given as a treatment.
there is no strong evidence that these treatments work well.
there is evidence that the antiviral medicine, ribavirin, does not work.
outlook (prognosis)
in the 2004 outbreak, the death rate from sars was 9% to 12% of those diagnosed.
in people over age 65, the death rate was higher than 50%.
the illness was milder in younger people.
in the older population, many more people became sick enough to need breathing assistance.
and even more people had to go to hospital intensive care units.
public health policies have been effective at controlling outbreaks.
many nations have stopped the epidemic in their own countries.
all countries must continue to be careful to keep this disease under control.
viruses in the coronavirus family are known for their ability to change (mutate) in order to spread among humans.
possible complications
complications may include:
respiratory failure
liver failure
heart failure
when to contact a medical professional
call your provider if you or someone you have been in close contact with sars.
prevention
reducing your contact with people who have sars lowers your risk for the disease.
avoid travel to places where there is an uncontrolled sars outbreak.
when possible, avoid direct contact with people who have sars until at least 10 days after their fever and other symptoms are gone.
hand hygiene is the most important part of sars prevention.
wash your hands or clean them with an alcohol-based instant hand sanitizer.

normally, in most contexts, the opposite of "kinetic" (moving) could be "static" (not moving).
when talking about 'energy' the opposite of "kinetic" can be "potential", i.e., kinetic energy vs potential energy.
an object in ballistic motion (i.e., moving only under the influence of a simple gravitational field) may exchange its energy between kinetic and potential forms, perhaps even repeatedly, but the sum of the two will remain constant.
examples (neglecting friction) include a pendulum, a roller coaster and a satellite in an elliptical orbit.

how can an object accelerate if kinetic friction is equal and opposite to horizontal force which would mean it has a net force of zero?
it wouldn't accelerate.
it would move at a constant velocity due to its tendency to keep moving (inertia) and friction being canceled out by the horizontal force.

there are three kinds of answers: ones that are mostly right, ones that are mostly wrong, and those that once were right but now are wrong.
what is the opposite of you?
from the standpoint of interpersonal operations (what the first person i, does in relationship to a second person, you), the opposite of you is me, or i.
similarly, from the s … tandpoint of here or there, the word they or them may be the opposite of both you, i, we, or us.
--- however, technically there is no opposite word or antonym.
to be antonyms of each other, words need to express opposing concepts; for example: bad/good cold/hot hard/soft concepts that are different from one another aren't opposites.
word pairs which are frequently used to express a concept of difference include: black/white cat/dog me/you these three aren't actual antonyms.
for example, while the terms black and white describe concepts that are different, so do orange and white, green and purple, and so on.
similarly, cat and bear, or dog and sheep, describe different concepts.
while one could endlessly debate fine points of opposition or differentness between word pairs, the concept of an antonym remains clear.
so questions such as 'what is the opposite of cat?' or 'what is the opposite of black?' are only answerable by suggesting something different, not something opposite.
in the same way, 'you' doesn't have an opposite, and there is no opposite to 'me', either.
on the other hand, 'he' and 'she' are opposites according to gender.
* in a physics context, black and white are opposite with respect to the absorption of light (things appear black when they absorb all colors, white when they reflect all colors).
--- questions regarding words that do not have true opposites can only provide antonyms with regard to a specific quality, because most things do not have exact opposites.

a mutation in a gametic (sex) cell would be passed on to offspring, whereas mutations in somatic (body) cells are not passed on.
the reason for this is somatic cells are not p … assed on during sexual intercourse so there is no way for this to be transferred and inherited by the offspring.
gametes, on the other hand, are transferred to the offspring through fertilization.

page content
​​​​​​​ ​the alquist-priolo earthquake fault zoning act was passed in 1972 to mitigate the hazard of surface faulting to structures for human occupancy.
this state law was a direct result of the 1971 san fernando earthquake, which was associated with extensive surface fault ruptures that damaged numerous homes, commercial buildings, and other structures.
surface rupture is the most easily avoided seismic hazard.
what is the alquist-priolo act?
the alquist-priolo earthquake fault zoning act's main purpose is to prevent the construction of buildings used for human occupancy on the surface trace of active faults.
the act only addresses the hazard of surface fault rupture and is not directed toward other earthquake hazards.
the seismic hazards mapping act, passed in 1990, addresses non-surface fault rupture earthquake hazards, including liquefaction and seismically induced landslides.
how does the law work?
the law requires the state geologist to establish regulatory zones (known as earthquake fault zones) around the surface traces of active faults and to issue appropriate maps.
["earthquake fault zones" were called "special studies zones" prior to january 1, 1994.]
the maps are distributed to all affec​ted cities, counties, and state agencies for their use in planning and controlling new or renewed construction.
local agencies must regulate most development projects within the zones.
projects include all land divisions and most structures for human occupancy.
single family wood-frame and steel-frame dwellings up to two stories not part of a development of four units or more are exempt.
however, local agencies can be more restrictive than state law requires.
before a project can be permitted, cities and counties must require a geologic investigation to demonstrate that proposed buildings will not be constructed across active faults.
an evaluation and written report of a specific site must be prepared by a licensed geologist.
if an active fault is found, a structure for human occupancy cannot be placed over the trace of the fault and must be set back from the fault (generally 50 feet).
what is an earthquake fault zone?
earthquake fault zones are regulatory zones around active faults.
on the earthquake fault zone maps, the zones are shown as shaded yellow polygons that encompass mapped fault traces.the zones vary in width, but average about one-quarter mile wide.
on older maps, the zones are defined by turning points (small circles with a center dot) connected by straight lines.
earthquake fault zones are plotted on topographic maps at a scale of 1 inch equals 2,000 feet.
what is a fault?
a fault is a fracture in the crust of the earth along which rocks on one side have moved relative to those on the other side.
most faults are the result of repeated displacements over a long period of time.
a fault trace is the line on the earth's surface defining the fault.
for the purposes of the act, an active fault is one that has ruptured in the last 11,000 years.
what is "surface rupture" in an earthquake?
surface rupture occurs when movement on a fault deep within the earth breaks through to the surface.
surface ruptures associated with the 1992 landers earthquake, in san bernardino county, extended for 50 miles with displacements of an inch to 20 feet.
not all earthquakes result in surface rupture.
the loma prieta earthquake of 1989 caused major damage in the san francisco bay area but the movement deep in the earth did not break through to the surface.
fault rupture almost always follows preexisting faults, which are zones of weakness.
rupture may occur suddenly during an earthquake or slowly in the form of fault creep.
sudden displacements are more damaging to structures because they are accompanied by shaking.
fault creep is the slow rupture of the earth's crust.
examples of creep are well known along the hayward fault where it crosses highly developed areas in contra costa and alameda counties.
although the hayward fault ruptured suddenly in the 1868 earthquake, it also exhibits slow surface creep which offsets and deforms curbs, streets, buildings, and other structures that lie on top of the fault.
how can i tell if a property is in an earthquake fault zone?
earthquake fault zone maps are available for download from the california geological survey’s website here , and are also available at local planning departments.
these maps show most streets, drainages, and other features.
local government may have already transferred earthquake fault zone boundaries to parcel maps, so the relationship of the zone to each parcel can easily be determined.
does the law require that all real estate within an earthquake fault zone be disclosed as such before it is sold?
the fact that a property is located in an earthquake fault zone must be disclosed to a potential buyer before the sales process is complete.
the real estate agent is legally bound to present this information to the buyer.
when no realtor is involved, the seller must inform the buyer directly.
this is usually done at the time an offer is made or accepted.
effective june 1, 1998, the natural hazards disclosure act requires that sellers of real property and their agents provide prospective buyers with a "natural hazard disclosure statement" when the property being sold lies within one or more state-mapped hazard areas, including earthquake fault zones.
what does an earthquake fault zone mean to me?
it means that an active fault is present near or within the land parcel and may pose a risk of surface fault rupture to existing or future structures.
if the property is not developed, a fault study may be required before the parcel can be subdivided or structures permitted.
see the definition of "project" under "how does the law work?"
check with your local permitting agency for specific requirements.
if a property is ​developed, you will not need a geologic study unless you plan to extensively add onto or remodel an existing structure.
see exemptions above and check with your local permitting agency.
you can learn more about the potential of fault rupture by:
asking the property owner or real estate agent to see any geologic report prepared for the site.
checking the files of local government for consulting reports for nearby sites.
also, most fault investigations required by the alquist- priolo act are on file with the california geological survey.
researching maps and data on active faults at technical libraries at the california geological survey, u.s. geological survey, and universities.
hiring a licensed geologist to provide a preliminary assessment of the fault-rupture hazard for a specific site.

how long can a person stay up without sleep
how long can a person stay awake
the average person is awake for about 14 to 16 hours per day.
most could extend that to about 20 hours if they were to stay up later; up to 40 hours is easy once a person gets beyond the 24 hour mark; longer than 60 hours (staying awake straight through two nights and three days) is rare, but doable; the record is 264 hours or 11 days straight.

the average person is awake for about 14 to 16 hours per day.
most could extend that to about 20 hours if they were to stay up later; up to 40 hours is easy once a person gets beyond the 24 hour mark; longer than 60 hours (staying awake straight through two nights and three days) is rare, but doable; the record is 264 hours or 11 days straight.

i drink energy drink...but after 2-3 hours you have a little thing that i like to call "an energy drink crash"..its when you have only drank energy drinks for a while and you … get shaky and you feel really weak..it is the worst feeling i think i have ever felt...

how long can a human stay awake?
voluntarily, about a week i think is the record.
but i did see this show on national geographic once about a very rare sleeping disorder.
the show told the story of a man, a h … igh-school clarinet teacher, who gradually lost the ability to fall asleep.
after about six sleepless months he finally lay down for a permanent rest, but not before such a lack of sleep deteriorated his body and spirit completely.
how long can someone stay awake?
4 days...but its not soo much the person, its more of the muscles in the body...like the muscles in the eyelids that start getting heavy...the brain focuses on sleep related a … ctions like sitting on the couch...or leaning up against something...the muscles in your body begin to start getting heavy where is your mind is awake and thinking constantly but your body has shut down and its harder to do anything...you are past that tired phase into the completely delusional phase and it becomes a full on battle with yourself to stay awake...

how do you stay awake for a long time?
because your brain can tell you that it is daytime and night time so if it's daytime, you will be awake but if its night (eg; 10:00) you will feel tired

how long it is possible to stay awake?
after 4 days your brain just stops working and you will just pass out.
i would not recommend trying to stay awake for long periods as it can really mess you up.

how can you stay awake for a long time?
you must drink plenty of water!!
no fruit juice, no soda, no coffee, yes that's righr. no coffee. it is a misconception that caffeine will actually make you stay awake, the … caffeine in the coffee will make your heart beat faster and your reflex form the body will then distribute adrenaline accordingly, this is what gives you that "aware" feeling, however, this releasing adrenaline this way will not last long, as the stimulus from the caffeine actually wears opff in just 15 minutes. you either have to bite the grit and bear it, or, excercise.
yes excercise. why? you say? well think about it, excerciusing ups your heart beat, hlaf an hours aerobic and strength building excercise will ensure that your muscles are loose, full of adrenaline and lactic acid (that's bad but do some stretching afterwards) remember that it is really important that you drink water and plenty of it. also the more water you drink the more you will have to get up and pee, helping you to stay awake. i still wouldn't recomend this for more than 3 days though. i have tried a week solid no sleep, but i collapsed and spent 3 days in emergency care....
how long can you stay awake for?
i have personally stayed up for 8 days.
on the eve of the 4th day i began to hallucinate.
it sounds fun but it can be dangerous.
i had licked gummy bears and covered an entire … door and don't remember doing it.

how can a person stay awake all night long?
you will find that if you were to sleep in the day, or have on and off short naps throughout the day, you would most likely stay awake all night.
many people that suffer fr … om insomnia sometimes stay awake all night and end up falling asleep in the day through no fault of their own.

in vivo
from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
jump to: navigation , search
for other uses, see in vivo (disambiguation) .
studies that are in vivo ( latin for "within the living"; often not italicized in english [1] [2] [3] ) are those in which the effects of various biological entities are tested on whole, living organisms or cells , usually animals, including humans, and plants, as opposed to a tissue extract or dead organism.
this is not to be confused with experiments done in vitro ("within the glass"), i.e., in a laboratory environment using test tubes, petri dishes , etc. examples of investigations in vivo include: the pathogenesis of disease by comparing the effects of bacterial infection with the effects of purified bacterial toxins; the development of antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and new drugs generally; and new surgical procedures.
consequently, animal testing and clinical trials are major elements of in vivo research.
in vivo testing is often employed over in vitro because it is better suited for observing the overall effects of an experiment on a living subject.
in drug discovery , for example, verification of efficacy in vivo is crucial, because in vitro assays can sometimes yield misleading results with drug candidate molecules that are irrelevant in vivo (e.g., because such molecules cannot reach their site of in vivo action, for example as a result of rapid catabolism in the liver).
[4]
the english microbiologist professor harry smith and his colleagues in the mid-1950s showed the importance of in vivo studies.
they found that sterile filtrates of serum from animals infected with bacillus anthracis were lethal for other animals, whereas extracts of culture fluid from the same organism grown in vitro were not.
this discovery of anthrax toxin through the use of in vivo experiments had a major impact on studies of the pathogenesis of infectious disease.
the maxim in vivo veritas ("in a living thing [there is] truth") [5] is used to describe this type of testing and is a play on in vino veritas , ("in wine [there is] truth"), a well-known proverb.

in vivo vs. ex vivo research [ edit ]
in microbiology, in vivo is often used to refer to experimentation done in live isolated cells rather than in a whole organism, for example, cultured cells derived from biopsies.
in this situation, the more specific term is ex vivo .
once cells are disrupted and individual parts are tested or analyzed, this is known as in vitro .
methods of use [ edit ]
according to christopher lipinski and andrew hopkins, "whether the aim is to discover drugs or to gain knowledge of biological systems, the nature and properties of a chemical tool cannot be considered independently of the system it is to be tested in. compounds that bind to isolated recombinant proteins are one thing; chemical tools that can perturb cell function another; and pharmacological agents that can be tolerated by a live organism and perturb its systems are yet another.
if it were simple to ascertain the properties required to develop a lead discovered in vitro to one that is active in vivo , drug discovery would be as reliable as drug manufacturing."

this recipe is an easy and satisfying way to transform leftover ham and a ham bone into a hearty meal.
start this classic soup by simmering a ham bone or ham hocks with water to create a savory broth.
add carrots, celery, onion, and white beans and cook until softened.
mash up some of the beans to thicken the soup, then stir in diced ham.
serve with crusty bread for a simple lunch or dinner.
what to buy: in case you’re having trouble finding cannellini beans, they’re sometimes labeled white kidney beans instead.

instructions
1 place the beans in a large bowl and pick through them, removing and discarding any broken beans or stones.
cover them with at least 3 inches of cold water.
allow to soak uncovered and at room temperature at least 8 hours or overnight.
drain in a colander and set aside.
2 place the measured water and ham bone or hocks in a dutch oven or a large, heavy-bottomed pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
reduce the heat to medium and simmer uncovered for 1 hour.
3 add the soaked beans and thyme, stir to combine (leave the bone or hocks in the pot), and return to a simmer, skimming the surface with a spoon as necessary to remove any scum.
cook, stirring occasionally, until the beans are almost completely tender but still a little underdone in the center, about 1 hour (the beans should not be completely cooked because they will cook more later).
4 meanwhile, peel and cut the carrots into medium dice and place in a medium bowl.
cut the celery and onion into medium dice and add them to the bowl with the carrots.
add the diced vegetables and measured salt to the pot, stir to combine, and bring to a simmer.
cook, stirring occasionally, until the beans and vegetables are tender and the meat is falling off the bone, about 40 minutes more.
turn off the heat.
5 remove the ham bone or hocks to a cutting board and let sit until cool enough to handle.
remove the meat from the bones and set it aside (discard the skin and bones).
6 using a potato masher, lightly mash half of the beans and vegetables, leaving the remaining half intact.
stir in the diced and reserved ham.
taste and season with salt and pepper as needed.

this simple cold-weather soup is an easy go-to when you crave comfort—creamy and full of body, yet not as heavy as other dairy-based soups.

why were some people more afraid of communism than of hitler?
answer   communism was and still is just as big a threat to freedom and democracy as fascism/nazism, particularly when you have dictators such as mao or stalin.  …
mao was not in power in the 1930's but stalin was.
it was during this time that he committed numerous heteroclites initiated by purging his government of lenin supporters though mass executions.
stalin's predecessor leon trotsky, stalin�s predecessor and stalin himself were the only then living members of lenin's cabinet, trotsky having fled to mexico where he was assassinated in 1940.
another event which made the ukrainians both fearful and hateful of the communists was the holdomor.
after independence in 1918 the ukrainian people began to rediscover their culture, similar to what happened amongst canadian /american first nations in the 1970�s.
in addition whilst russians farmed as peasants on large noble estates which could be easily, nationalised into collective farms, ukrainian farms were operated by small landowners similar to american farms.
as such the soviet government began efforts to bring the ukrainians into collective farms throughout the 1920�s with little success.
often farmers would kill livestock out of civil disobedience or actively resist soviet forces.
in 1930 with declining agricultural production the death penalty was introduced for destruction of public property, including livestock which ukrainian farmers owned themselves.
on november 9, 1932 a commission headed by vyacheslav molotov recommended soviet security agencies; remove all beets, vegetables and potatoes from villages which did not have grain.
on december 6 a decree was passed banning the trading goods and food with villages which did not meet quotas.
no consideration was made as to next years crop or how peasants would feed themselves through the winter.
such policy continued until by 1938 7-10 million people were killed.
in world war 2 the ukrainians initially views the germans as liberators.

who killed more people hitler or stalin?
stalin killed more than hitler killed.
conservative estimates place  those killed by stalin around 20 million whereas more liberal  estimates jump to 60-70 million, with a l … ikely number in 40  millions.
hitler killed 11 million in the holocaust and millions of  other civilians during world war ii.
why do most people not know that mao ze dong killed more people than hitler?
the simple answer is that people who support mao zedong are still in power, therefore, mao's atrocity is not publicized, and in many cases prohibited to openly talk about in m … ainland china.
while hitler lost his notorious war and his evil face was completely exposed the day nazi germany failed.
there is also the fact that hitler is most known for the holocaust ans its practices on genocide, which means that it was all organized crime, while mao zedong only annihilated political oposition.
according to r. j. rummel,professor emeritus of political science and a nobel peace prize finalist, mao's policies led to the deaths of nearly 77 million of his countrymen, far surpassing the deaths attributed to hitler and stalin.

who killed more people hitler or elizabath ii?
i think hitler because he killed likely one milllions people in gremany and in french.
i am not aware of the numbers of people killed by hm queen elizabeth ii.
hitler on … the other hand seems to have been responsible for a rather larger number........
i might suggest that the implication of asking hm the queen such a question might get you a stay in the tower of london......

who killed more people stalin hitler or pol pot?
stalin killed way more people than hitler...
hitlers death number  was about 5 times less than stalin and only reason hitler is  recognized more often is because he was an a … nti-semite and he only  targeted certain races whereas stalin destroyed anyone who opposed  his authority.
usually when stalin killed someone it escalated to  killing any connections to that person and the numbers grew.
hitler  started small and ended small compared to stalin.
hitler by far, although stalin and pot didn't do it in small  amounts.
let's take a look at hitler's accounting:   six million jews, thousands of romanis (gypsies), a couple hundred  black gi's, around hundred fifty to two hundred homosexuals at  least a couple thousands of jehova witnesses, approximately five  hundred muslims, couple more, couple less, thirty to forty  "communists", and twenty million soviets.
these are the ones that have been accounted for, but there's the  very much shared suspicion that there are many, many, many more...

do white people kill more people than black?
the question shouldn't be who kills more: whites or blacks?
the question should be "what can we, as a society, do to keep people from killing?"
death at the hand of another sh … ould not be valued or de-valued by the race of the killer.

do coconuts kill more people a year than sharks?
no!
the idea that cocunuts kill 15 times more people than sharks started wih a study by dr peter barss.
he stated that in four years only five people were killed by coconuts … .
the research got misread to become 150.
your chance of dying from a coconut is probably less than the chance of being hit by a spaceship.
but coconuts do harm more people than sharks.
these victims are usually knocked unconscious or suffer from a concussion.

how many more people did mao tse tung kill than hitler?
hitler murdered an esti mated 11 million, this is not the war  casualties this is from concentration/death camps, and random  shootings of what they considered undesirables. …
mao tse yung has starved, murdered an estimated 35 million during  his regime, in his country.
answer    it's more than that: mao tse yung killed more people than hitler  and stalin combined.
if you include "the great leap  forward " [aka "the great stride") [1958 - 1961 ] mao tse yung  killed an estimated 65 million during his regime.

did stalin kill more people than hitler?
yes, stalin killed more, although neither ordered killing  directly.
they often just hinted at it.
hitler hinted at the killling of 17 million.
stalin has estimat … ed murders of between 3 and 60 million people -  it is currently generally said that he killed over 20 million  people during his leadership.
_____________    a lot depends on whether one regards the ukrainian famine of the  early 1930s as genocide or incompetence.
my comments on the above answers    (1)   adolph hitler in his famous biography "mien kampf" did more than  just hint at killing jews.
no-body can ever say that he didn't make  this absolutely plain.
( that's why his book is such a big seller  in the anti-semitic arabic countries.)
(2)   the ukrainian famine of the early 1930s was not incompetence but a  carefully planned pogrom against the pro-independant,  anti-collectivist, peace-loving ukrainians many of whom just  happened to be jewish.
stalin hated dissidents (but then , so did  hitler).
(3)   as kevin weaver commented on the article "why did the nazis want  the jews dead?"
at "quora" :-    "again, these are just speculations about why - or how - it was  possible that hitler hated the jews.
it's also likely that he was a  certifiable sociopath, in which case no explanation is necessary."
both hitler and stalin were sociopaths, which is a new name for  "psychopaths".
as many people would never have even heard of  "sociopaths, the definition of the older word "psychopath" is:    " a person afflicted with a personality disorder characterised by a  tendency to committ antisocial and sometimes violent acts and a  failure to feel guilt for such acts."
(4)   as the old saying goes, "the winner writes the history".
hitler was on the losing side and is painted black as black, but  because he was one of the allies on the winning side stalin came  out snow-white and smelling of roses (until the cold war !)
both dictatore were paranoid, power-hungry control-freaks ,  distrustful and cunning with little to choose between them. .

why do people hate hitler more than stalin if stalin killed so many more people?
hitler had ideas for the genocide of an entire type of people.
he had jews killed mercilessly out of hate.
hitler started the second world war, the biggest of any to have ever … happened.
stalin may have killed more but he did so for different reasons.
many peasants were killed due to stalin's plan to modernise and collectivise russia.
the ones killed were ones who he saw would pose problems in the goal to revolutionise russia and her heavy industry.
he was a very paranoid man.
people are often also taught less and hear less about stalin.
they know he killed many people but they don't know why or the specifics.
why does hitler get so much hate when it's a well known fact the japanese murdered close to 20 million chinese?
as well as mass rape and infanticide?
why is hitler a household name whereas hirohito is not?
i'm guessing you're american or western, so if you are american, you should know there is a very large jewish population in america, and that america supports israel (even though israel have and still do horrible things) the japanese were in many ways worse than the germans but due to the fact there are many jews in western society (and not as many chinese), the holocaust is going to be more well known than say the rape of nanking and other horrible atrocities inflicted by the japanese.
also it's pretty well known that zionists use the holocaust as an excuse to do horrible things to the palestinians.

did pol pot kill more people than adolf hitler?
no.
while both were awful, terrible people, pol pot is only responsible for killing (estimated) around 2 million people.
just the jews killed in the holocaust numbered around … 6 million.
throw in the other people killed as part of the holocaust (polish and other slavic people, homosexuals, communists, socialists, people with disabilities, the list goes on and on...) and then world war ii, and hitler wins that grim contest.

cyclone formation
how do cyclones form?
the above figure shows how cyclones form.
the green arrows show where warm air is rising.
the red arrows indicate where cool air is sinking.
•          tropical cyclones form only over warm ocean waters near the equator.
•          to form a cyclone, warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward from near the surface.
as this air moves up and away from the ocean surface, it leaves is less air near the surface.
so basically as the warm air rises, it causes an area of lower air pressure below.
•          air from surrounding areas with higher air pressure pushes in to the low pressure area.
then this new “cool” air becomes warm and moist and rises, too.
and the cycle continues…
•          as the warmed, moist air rises and cools the water in the air forms clouds.
the whole system of clouds and wind spins and grows, fed by the ocean’s heat and water evaporating from the ocean surface.
•          as the storm system rotates faster and faster, an eye forms in the centre.
it is very calm and clear in the eye, with very low air pressure.
higher pressure air from above flows down into the eye.
when the winds in the rotating storm reach 39 mph (63 kmph), the storm is called a “tropical storm”.
and when the wind speeds reach 74 mph (119 kmph), the storm is officially a “tropical cyclone” or hurricane.
tropical cyclones usually weaken when they hit land, because they are no longer being “fed” by the energy from the warm ocean waters.
however, they often move far inland, dumping many centimeters of rain and causing lots of wind damage before they die out completely.
cyclone categories
fig: the saffir-simpson hurricane scale
•          cyclones are divided into categories depending on the strength of the winds produced.
there are many different classification scales but one you may be familiar with is the saffir-simpson hurricane scale.
this scale is used to desribe storms in hollywood movies, e.g. “twister” and “the day after tomorrow”.
•          the classifications (1-5) are intended primarily for use in measuring the potential damage and flooding (storm surge) a cyclone will cause upon landfall.

the shining is a 1980 psychological horror film directed by stanley kubrick, based on stephen king 's novel of the same name .
though it had mixed reviews from the critics upon its release, it was wildly popular with moviegoers and was financially successful.
it is now frequently ranked as one of the best horror films as well as one of the greatest films in history and its iconic and surreal imagery is deeply embedded throughout popular culture, although there was a long interval between its release and its achievement of iconic status.
director stanley kubrick co-wrote the screenplay with novelist diane johnson.
the film stars jack nicholson as tormented writer jack torrance, shelley duvall as his wife wendy, and danny lloyd as their son, danny.
plot edit
the film tells the story of a writer, jack torrance (jack nicholson), who accepts the job of the winter caretaker at a hotel that always gets snowed in during the winter.
jack's son shares psychic abilities with the hotel's chef who calls it "shining".
they can see things in the past, such as the ghosts of murdered people in the hotel.
when the hotel becomes snowbound, jack torrance is influenced by the ghosts in the haunted hotel and descends into madness trying to murder his wife and son.
initial response to the film was mixed and it performed moderately at the box office.
subsequent critical assessment of the film has been more favorable and it is now viewed as a classic of the horror genre.
the novel's author stephen king has had very conflicted feelings about it (see reception and comparison with the book) which have oscillated over time.
a tv mini-series adaptation of the novel broadcast in 1997 saw king more actively involved.

best answer: metals
- a typical metal is a hard, shiny solid that --due to metallic bonding -- is malleable, ductile, and a good
conductor.
- malleable means it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
- metallic bonding is where positively charged metallic ions are surrounded by a �sea of electrons.�
- group 1 is the alkali earth metals.
they are good conductors of heat and electricity, and they are highly
reactive.
they include: lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium.
- group 2 is the alkaline earth metals.
they are so reactive that they aren�t found free in nature.
they include:
beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium.
- transition elements (groups 3-12) include: the iron triad; the coinage metals (copper, silver, gold); and the zinc,
cadmium, and mercury.
- only elements in the iron triad (iron, cobalt, nickel) can be magnetic.
- copper is often used in electric wiring due to its ability to conduct electricity.
-coinage metals-- resistant to rusting and other chemical reactions,--- cu, ag, au

how do night vision goggles work?
night goggles   a beam of infrared light is sent out which is invisible to the human eye.
however just like a digital camera the goggles can pick up the infrared light an … d convert it into the visible spectrum and display it on an small lcd screen inside the goggles.
wearing these on guard duty a couple years ago i found them very strange.
first all you have no depth perception and if you look at anything too bright you're gonna get blinded (temporary).
sorry i don't know the technicalities but i would find out by looking for a book at your local library consortium under "how things work".
new answer headline   night vision goggles, (nvg), work by amplifying light � moonlight, starlight - in the near infra red, (nir), region of the spectrum � approx� 600nm to 930nm, (gen iii).
nvgs incorporate automatic gain control, (agc), this controls the amplification, (gain), of the nvg which helps maintains an acceptable level of contrast of the image presented to the viewer.
e.g. a scene viewed under illumination from the full moon will cause the nvg amplification / gain to reduce.
the same scene viewed with little nir illumination will cause the nvg amplification / gain to increase and results in a reduction in the quality of the image being viewed due to �spangles�, (flashing pin points of light on the image), which is �noise� from the amplification / gain process.
incandescent bulbs in addition to visible light, release most of the energy produced in the nir and ir spectrum, (heat).
nvgs used by a sentry to view an approaching vehicle which has illuminated headlights, will find the nvg �blinded� by the amount of nir being produced by the headlights, similarly nvg used by a pilot can be �blinded� by cockpit illumination � the agc can only cope with a limited range of nir illumination before the goggle is saturated � �blinded�.
the image presented to the viewer using nvg is monochromatic � green.
the image is 2 dimensional � no perception of depth.
this makes operating a vehicle or aircraft using nvgs very difficult, since distance and closing speeds are very difficult to assess.
most of the nvg sold commercially are � at best - gen ii, which is very poor in comparison to the gen iii - restricted technology � currently used by the military.
passive nvg's work like this:   light photons will come it (any tiny bit of light, moonlight, starlight), and come into the goggle, and it turned into electrons. then, it hits a very thin charged disc, with millions of channels in it. the electrons hit this, and going through the channels it will release millions more electrons. then, these electrons hit a phosphor screen and they basically spread the very little bit of light all over the phosphor screen so you can see. it is actually manifactured so it turns out green, because the human eye can decipher many different shades of green than any other color.

what can night vision goggles be used for?
night vision goggles can be used wherever the user needs to see in low light conditions.
older, light-amplification types require at least some light, but starlight is more th … an adequate.
modern devices use mostly infra-red light, and include infra-red led lights, so function well even if there is zero natural illumination.

are there chinese animals of chinese new year?
if you mean the chinese zodiac, there are 12 of them.
in sequence, rat, bull, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog, pig.
in that sequence, each year … is a different "animal year".
for example, 2012 would be the year of the dragon.
an infant born this year would be said to be born in the year of the dragon, as with those who were born in 2000, 1988 and so on (in 12-year cycles).
one should note that the chinese "year" is not as clear-cut as the western solar year.
although for all official purposes the chinese uses the solar calendar, there are still some tradition-based occasions which use the lunar calendar, including mid-autumn festival and chinese new year.
this year the chinese new year was on the 23rd of january.
thus if a child was born on the 22nd of january s/he would still be considered born in the year of the rabbit.
this can make finding out someone's zodiac difficult if s/he was born in the end of january/early february, since the actual date of the chinese new year changes year to year between the two months.
so there is no fixed animal for chinese new year.
this year no one would mention much of the snake.
the dragon, however, is rather popular no matter what zodiac year it is.
it would be much more popular on "dragon" years, however.

most fruits contain an insignificant amount of protein.
some fruits that do have a good amount of protein include: avocados, guava, passion fruit, and pomegranate.
most other fruits have 1 g of protein or less per serving.
be sure to eat fruits in moderation because they are high in sugar.

the odyssey study guide
buy study guide
most likely written between 750 and 650 b.c.,
the odyssey is an epic poem about the wanderings of the greek hero odysseus following his victory in the trojan war (which, if it did indeed take place, occurred in the 12th-century b.c. in mycenaean greece).
originally composed in the ionic greek dialect in dactylic hexameter (most english translations use iambic pentameter), the odyssey , alongside the slightly earlier iliad (a violent account of the trojan war), ushered in a new age of western literature.
the odyssey has been so influential that its primary theme -- the desire for home -- may be the most important one in modern narratives, used for stories as diverse as the wizard of oz and james joyce's directly allusive ulysses .
the odyssey is also notable for its exploration of its hero's sensitive interior life, a stark contrast to the nonstop action of the iliad .
there has been fervent debate, especially since the 19th century, over the authorship of both poems.
some scholars maintain that they are the work of multiple writers, while others believe that both are the product of a blind bard named homer .
it is now generally agreed that a singer-poet named homer from the city of smyrna on the western coast of asia minor did exist around the time of the composition of both poems, though the rest is still disputable.
one likely theory is that the illiterate homer had memorized heroic stories that had been passed down through the ages and altered them slightly when he sang them to audiences and strummed a simple stringed instrument for musical accompaniment.
someone else then cobbled together homer's various narratives and wrote down first the iliad , then the odyssey , most likely on a papyrus scroll.
the stories were then copied, and undoubtedly evolved, over time, helping explain particularly the uneven final third of t he odyssey .
to buy them time between improvisations, the singer-poets repeated stories (such as that of agamemnon's murder in the odyssey) and used recurring epithets -- pithy tags attached to characters ("grey-eyed athena ," "swift-footed achilles") -- and epic (or homeric) similes, or repetitive poetic comparisons ("rosy-fingered dawn," "the wine-dark sea").
it is important to remember that the iliad and the odyssey were originally oral entertainment -- much of the pleasure for the ancient greeks came not from the narratives with which they were familiar, but rather from the sound of the poetry, which is still unmatched in the epic poetic tradition for its beauty and grandeur.

what is the scientific name or taxonomic classification for domestic cattle?
kingdom: animalia phylum: chordata class: mammalia subclass: cleria infraclass: theria order: artiodactyla suborder: cetruminantia infraorder: pecora family: bovidae …
subfamily: bovinae tribe: bovini genus: bos species: bos primigenius subspecies: bos primigenius taurus and bos primigenius indicus collectively, cattle are classified as bos primigenius, with sub-classifications or subspecies being bos primigenius taurus for the temperate or european-type cattle and bos primigenius indicus for the tropical or asian/african-type humped cattle.
in the past the aurochs (a true wild descendant of the domesticated bovines of today), temperate and tropical cattle were classified as three separate species: bos primigenius, bos taurus and bos indicus, respectively.
as new evidence is revealed about the history of the domestication of cattle and what their ancestors really were as well as how genetically close bos taurus and bos inidicus cattle are linked together, it is more proper to define them collectively as bos primigenius as the species, and bos primigenius primigenius, bos primigenius taurus and bos primigenius indicus as the subspecies of the aurochs, european-type and asian/african-type cattle, respectively.

baden powell - his story
baden-powell or b-p was born robert stephenson smyth baden-powell was on the 22 february 1857, the son of professor baden-powell, of oxford university.
his father died when he was 3 years old and his mother devoted herself to bringing up a rather large family of 10.
baden powell and his brothers were encouraged by their mother to make their own fun.
they learned about the outdoors, built boats and sailed them and went on long journeys learning to look after themselves.
baden-powell attended charterhouse school during which time he took part in a number of activities including acting, singing and cadet corps and art.
in the woods near the school known as "the copse" he studied, stalked and tracked animals, birds and his friends and teachers.
baden-powell was encouraged to sit army exams, he surprised everyone by gaining 2nd place out of 700 candidates, as a result was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in the 13th hussars.
he sailed to join his regiment in lucknow, india, where he took courses in surveying and reconnaissance.
he was quickly promoted and moved up through the ranks and trained his men using competitions and games and taught them how to track and live in wild country.
he also wrote a book called "aids to scouting" about his methods of army training.
this book was later to become the bases of scouting
in 1887 he was sent to south africa where he took part in a campaign against an african chief called dinizulu
in 1899 colonel baden-powell returned to south africa. because there was the possibility of war between the dutch settlers (boers) and the british settlers.
war was declared and baden-powell and 1000 men were left to defend the town of mafeking, which was the supply center for the british, he thought up all sorts of schemes to make it look like the town was heavily guarded.
when reinforcements arrived the siege had lasted for 7 months.
baden-powell took part in a number of other conflicts and in 1903 was appointed inspector-general of cavalry.
in july 1907 b-p ran a camp for a group of boys on brownsea island in poole harbour.
in 1909 b-p was knighted by king edward vii for his outstanding military career and especially for founding scouting
baden-powell died in kenya in 1941 when he was almost 84 on his gravestone under the badges of the scouts and guides is carved.
"robert baden-powell, chief scout of the world"
the following article about b-p's grave appeared in the october 2001 issue of � scouting magazine - the magazine of the uk scout association, which in my opinion is good news for the scout movement across the world

there are many japanese words for it.
fire is "hi" when referring to the element of fire, "kaji" when used in the sense of a destructive force (a house fire, for example).
the kanji symbol for fire also means 'tuesday' if you add "yobi".
"ka" is generally used to describe fire as an element.

what does fire mean in japanese?
kagi means fire in japanese improvement: kagi is incorrect.
kagi translates either to hook, or to either key or lock.
the following words are appropriate japanese translat … ions for "fire": hi (pronounced "hee") = "fire; flame; blaze" hinote (pronounced "hee - noh - tay") = "flames; blaze; fire" ka = "fire", as describing one of the five elements - fire, water, earth, wood, and metal - in chinese cosmology.
kaji = "fire; conflagration" kaki = "fire" kasai = "fire; conflagration"

how do you say dark fire in japanese?
暗い火事 (kurai kaji) would mean "dark fire" in japanese.
improvement: 火事 (kaji) means fire, but in a different sense than the element 'fire' itself.. it's used when e … .g you say 'the fire burnt down the building'.. in a meaning of 'conflagration'.
暗い火 (kurai hi) is more suited for 'drak fire', since 'fire' means 'flame, blaze' here.

is marth from fire emblem japanese?
game-wise, yes, marth was the character who started the series in  japan.
his first two games  fire emblem: shadow dragon and the blade of light and  fire emblem: mystery … of the emblem, which were played on the  nes and snes respectively, were never released outside of japan,  but he later received nintendo ds remakes of both of those games,  although only the first remake had an international release.
character-wise, marth is more closely related to a medieval  european culture and will most likely find japanese culture as  something foreign to him, as his later descendants (in fire  emblem: awakening) did not recognize a traditional  japanese-style clothing that a certain "foreign" character  (say'ri), who was more closely related to the traditional japanese  culture, was wearing.
thus, marth could be speaking japanese but  not actually be japanese; it's not entirely known.

can biting chewing the side of your mouth cause mouth cancer?
answer   whether biting and chewing the side of your mouth can lead to cancer, i hope others will give their input.
however, i can see where it might lead to infection (d … epending how deep).
still, i believe you should be asking yourself why you are biting, tearing, and chewing perfectly good mouth tissue that is there to serve a purpose.
it may be just a bad habit, or maybe something that goes deeper.
you should consult a health care professional for advice.
anyway you look at it, pulling apart your skin is not a good idea.
i'm not saying this to be funny, but out of concern for you.
viper1     i agree with viper. also if you bite it so much you cut through. that will really sting whilst eating.

confirmatory factor analysis techniques
200-31: exploratory or confirmatory factor analysis?
1
paper 200-31
exploratory or confirmatory factor analysis?
diana d. suhr, ph.d.
university of northern colorado
abstract
exploratory factor analysis (efa) could be described as orderly simplification of interrelated measures.
efa,
traditionally, has been used to explore the possible underlying factor structure of a set of observed variables without
imposing a preconceived structure on the outcome (child, 1990).
by performing efa, the underlying factor structure
is identified.
confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) is a statistical technique used to verify the factor structure of a set of observed
variables.
cfa allows the researcher to test the hypothesis that a relationship between observed variables and their
underlying latent constructs exists.
the researcher uses knowledge of the theory, empirical research, or both,
postulates the relationship pattern a priori and then tests the hypothesis statistically.
the process of data analysis with efa and cfa will be explained.
examples with factor and calis procedures
will illustrate efa and cfa statistical techniques.
introduction
cfa and efa are powerful statistical techniques.
an example of cfa and efa could occur with the development of
measurement instruments, e.g. a satisfaction scale, attitudes toward health, customer service questionnaire.
a
blueprint is developed, questions written, a scale determined, the instrument pilot tested, data collected, and cfa
completed.
the blueprint identifies the factor structure or what we think it is.
however, some questions may not
measure what we thought they should.
if the factor structure is not confirmed, efa is the next step.
efa helps us
determine what the factor structure looks like according to how participant responses.
exploratory factor analysis is
essential to determine underlying constructs for a set of measured variables.
confirmatory factor analysis
cfa allows the researcher to test the hypothesis that a relationship between the observed variables and their
underlying latent construct(s) exists.
the researcher uses knowledge of the theory, empirical research, or both,
postulates the relationship pattern a priori and then tests the hypothesis statistically.
the use of cfa could be impacted by
 the research hypothesis being testing
 the requirement of sufficient sample size (e.g., 5-20 cases per parameter estimate)
 measurement instruments
 multivariate normality
 parameter identification
 outliers
 missing data
 interpretation of model fit indices (schumacker & lomax, 1996).
a suggested approach to cfa proceeds through the following process:
 review the relevant theory and research literature to support model specification
 specify a model (e.g., diagram, equations)
 determine model identification (e.g., if unique values can be found for parameter estimation; the number of
degrees of freedom, df, for model testing is positive)
 collect data
 conduct preliminary descriptive statistical analysis (e.g., scaling, missing data, collinearity issues, outlier
detection)
 estimate parameters in the model
 assess model fit
 present and interpret the results.
statistics
traditional statistical methods normally utilize one statistical test to determine the significance of the analysis.
however, structural equation modeling (sem), cfa specifically, relies on several statistical tests to determine the
adequacy of model fit to the data.
the chi-square test indicates the amount of difference between expected and
observed covariance matrices.
a chi-square value close to zero indicates little difference between the expected and
observed covariance matrices.
in addition, the probability level must be greater than 0.05 when chi-square is close to
zero.

the comparative fit index (cfi) is equal to the discrepancy function adjusted for sample size.
cfi ranges from 0 to 1
with a larger value indicating better model fit.
acceptable model fit is indicated by a cfi value of 0.90 or greater (hu &
bentler, 1999).
root mean square error of approximation (rmsea) is related to residual in the model.
rmsea values range from 0
to 1 with a smaller rmsea value indicating better model fit.
acceptable model fit is indicated by an rmsea value of
0.06 or less (hu & bentler, 1999).
if model fit is acceptable, the parameter estimates are examined.
the ratio of each parameter estimate to its standard
error is distributed as a z statistic and is significant at the 0.05 level if its value exceeds 1.96 and at the 0.01 level it its
value exceeds 2.56 (hoyle, 1995).
unstandardized parameter estimates retain scaling information of variables and
can only be interpreted with reference to the scales of the variables.
standardized parameter estimates are
transformations of unstandardized estimates that remove scaling and can be used for informal comparisons of
parameters throughout the model.
standardized estimates correspond to effect-size estimates.
in cfa, if unacceptable model fit is found, an efa can be performed.
proc calis
the proc calis procedure (covariance analysis of linear structural equations) estimates parameters and tests
the appropriateness of structural equation models using covariance structural analysis.
although proc calis was
designed to specify linear relations, structural equation modeling (sem) techniques have the flexibility to test
nonlinear trends.
cfa is a special case of sem.
proc calis and options for cfa
data = specifies dataset to be analyzed
cov covariance matrix
corr correlation matrix
exploratory factor analysis
psychologists searching for a neat and tidy description of human intellectual abilities lead to the development of
factor analytic methods.
galton, a scientist during the 19 th and 20 th centuries, laid the foundations for factor analytic
methods by developing quantitative methods to determine the interdependence between 2 variables.
karl pearson
was the first to explicitly define factor analysis.
in 1902, macdonnell was the first to publish an application of factor
analysis, a comparison of physical characteristics between 3000 criminals and 1000 cambridge undergraduates.
factor analysis could be described as orderly simplification of interrelated measures.
traditionally factor analysis has
been used to explore the possible underlying structure of a set of interrelated variables without imposing any
preconceived structure on the outcome (child, 1990).
by performing exploratory factor analysis (efa), the number of
constructs and the underlying factor structure are identified.
efa
 is a variable reduction technique which identifies the number of latent constructs and the underlying factor
structure of a set of variables
 hypothesizes an underlying construct, a variable not measured directly
 estimates factors which influence responses on observed variables
 allows you to describe and identify the number of latent constructs (factors)
 includes unique factors, error due to unreliability in measurement
 traditionally has been used to explore the possible underlying factor structure of a set of measured variables
without imposing any preconceived structure on the outcome (child, 1990).
goals of factor analysis are
1) to help an investigator determine the number of latent constructs underlying a set of items (variables)
2) to provide a means of explaining variation among variables (items) using a few newly created variables
(factors), e.g., condensing information
3) to define the content or meaning of factors, e.g., latent constructs
assumptions underlying efa are
• interval or ratio level of measurement
• random sampling
• relationship between observed variables is linear
• a normal distribution (each observed variable)
• a bivariate normal distribution (each pair of observed variables)
• multivariate normality
sugi 31 statistics and data anal y sis
3
limitations of efa are
• the correlations, the basis of factor analysis, describe relationships.
no causal inferences can be made
from correlations alone.
• the reliability of the measurement instrument (avoid an instrument with low reliability)
• sample size ( larger sample æ larger correlation)
◊ minimal number of cases for reliable results is more then 100 observations and 5 times the number of
items
◊ since some subjects may not answer every item, a larger sample is desirable.
for example, 30 items
would require at least 150 cases (5*30), a sample of 200 subjects would allow for missing data
• sample selection
◊ representative of population
◊ do not pool populations
• variables could be sample specific, e.g., a unique quality possessed by a group does not generalize to the
population
• nonnormal distribution of data
factor extraction
factor analysis seeks to discover common factors.
the technique for extracting factors attempts to take out as much
common variance as possible in the first factor.
subsequent factors are, in turn, intended to account for the maximum
amount of the remaining common variance until, hopefully, no common variance remains.
direct extraction methods obtain the factor matrix directly from the correlation matrix by application of specified
mathematical models.
most factor analysts agree that direct solutions are not sufficient.
adjustment to the frames of
reference by rotation methods improves the interpretation of factor loadings by reducing some of the ambiguities
which accompany the preliminary analysis (child, 1990).
the process of manipulating the reference axes is known as
rotation.
rotation applied to the reference axes means the axes are turned about the origin until some alternative position has
been reached.
the simplest case is when the axes are held at 90 o to each other, orthogonal rotation.
rotating the
axes through different angles gives an oblique rotation (not at 90 o to each other).
criteria for extracting factors
determining the number of factors to extract in a factor analytic procedure means keeping the factors that account for
the most variance in the data.
criteria for determining the number of factors are:
1) kaiser’s criterion, suggested by guttman and adapted by kaiser, considers factors with an eigenvalue greater
than one as common factors (nunnally, 1978)
2) cattell’s (1966) scree test.
the name is based on an analogy between the debris, called scree, that collects at
the bottom of a hill after a landslide, and the relatively meaningless factors that result from overextraction.
on a
scree plot, because each factor explains less variance than the preceding factors, an imaginary line connecting
the markers for successive factors generally runs from top left of the graph to the bottom right.
if there is a point
below which factors explain relatively little variance and above which they explain substantially more, this usually
appears as an “elbow” in the plot.
this plot bears some physical resemblance to the profile of a hillside.
the
portion beyond the elbow corresponds to the rubble, or scree, that gathers.
cattell’s guidelines call for retaining
factors above the elbow and rejecting those below it.

rounding to the nearest hundred
when we round to the nearest hundred , the numbers “residing” in the red areas (up to 850) on the number line are rounded to 800.
the numbers in the blue areas are rounded to 900.
again, distance matters.
numbers from 801 to 849 are closer to 800 than to 900.
numbers from 851 to 899 are closer to 900 than to 800.
and the “middle guy,” 850, is rounded up to 900: 850 ≈ 900.
1.
mark the numbers as dots on the number line (approximately) and round them to either 800 or 900.

b.
825 ≈ ___________
850 ≈ ___________
c.
860 ≈ ___________
847 ≈ ___________
d.

892 ≈ ___________
when rounding to the nearest hundred , look at the tens digit of the number.
if that digit is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, you will round down to the previous hundred.
if that digit is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, you will round up to the next hundred.
7 2 8 ≈ ?
the tens digit is 2, so round down:
728 ≈ 700
4 7 1 ≈ ?
the tens digitis 7, so round up:
471 ≈ 500
9 5 6 ≈ ?
the tens digit is 5, so round up:

b.
529 ≈ ___________
960 ≈ ___________
c.
670 ≈ ___________
557 ≈ ___________
d.
254 ≈ ___________
147 ≈ ___________
things work similarly on this number line when rounding to the nearest hundred :
numbers up to 2,450 (the middle number) are rounded down to 2,400.
numbers after 2,450 are rounded up to 2,500.
and the middle guy, 2,450, is rounded up.
3.
round these numbers to 2,400 or to 2,500.
you can use the number line above to help you.
a. 2,412 ≈ __________
b. 2,429 ≈ __________
c. 2,478 ≈ ___________
d. 2,490 ≈ ___________
rounding rules
when rounding to the nearest hundred , look at the tens digit of the number.
if the tens digit is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, you will round down to the previous hundred.
7 2 8 ≈ ?
the tens digit is 2, so round down:
728 ≈ 700
notice: the hundreds digit does not change .
if that digit is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, you will round up to the next hundred.
4 7 1 ≈ ?
the tens digit is 7, so round up:
471 ≈ 500
notice: the hundreds digit increases by one , from 4 to 5.
whether you round up or down, the tens and ones digits change to zeros .

what is a non example?
when you are explaining a concept, you often use examples to make  your explanation clearer.
sarin, nerve gas and mustard gas would be  examples of chemical warfare agents. …
sometimes, you can improve  your explanation by giving examples that are not chemical  warfare agents, eg, oxygen.
these non-examples still have to have  some characteristics of the original example, but not the  significant characteristic that makes the original what it is.
some educators are now calling these "non-examples."
a maths teacher explaining equations might write:   3a + 2b = 7.
this is an equation.
12 - 8.
this is not an equation.
14b - 3 = 25.
this is an equation.
150>125.
this is not an equation.
students have the potential to learn as much from the non-examples  as from the examples.

can a fossil be non living?
all fossils are non-living.
however, they are always created by living things.
fossils are either a form of preserved remains of a living thing from at least hundreds of thous … ands of years ago (otherwise they are simply remains), or they are the remnants of signs of a living thing from an equally long period ago (footprints, imprints, fossilized dung, etc).

what is non-renewable and not a fossil fuel?
renewable means that it comes back again tomorrow even after we have used it as much as we can today, like sunlight, or wind or tidal power.
tropical rainforests are … non-renewable (well, not for hundreds and hundreds of years) and are not fossil fuel.
most non-renewable sources of energy are fossil fuels, but there are many minerals like gold and silver, etc, that are not fossil fuels, but are non-renewable.
strictly speaking if we wait around for millions of years some of them might renew, but generally we say, if we use up all the gold in the world today, then there's no more tomorrow.
non-renewable!

what are non-renewable fossil fuels?
non-renewable fossil fuels are coal, oil and natural gas.
they are called fossil fuels because they are made out of fossilized vegetation and animal matter that was laid down … under the ground millions of years ago.
they are called non-renewable because when they are burnt (in industry, transport and to generate electricity) they are gone for ever.
they can only be used once.
(unlike sunshine or wind power, which can be used over and over, and are called renewable.)

texas has no sol for child support it must be "paid in full".
if there is no court order for support the petition must be filed before the child or children reach the age of 18.
if there is a court order the support obligation must be paid in entirety.
this means that even when the child/children reach the age of majority (18) any amount in arrears still must be paid.
the court will determine if it is to be paid to the child or to the custodial parent or a combination thereof.

is there a statute of limitations on collecting child support?
some states do not have any sol's on child support when a court order is in affect and a state's deparatment of social or family issues is involved.
other states have statutes … that specify sol on child support by the years that are affected.
example: in mo. child support arrearages are recoverable if an order is in place and not more than 10 years has expired from each birthday.
for a 1-year-old arrearages are collectible before the child reaches ll, 2-year-old until 12 and so forth.
the legal age of majority for mo. is 18 therefore it is conceivable that arrearages could be collected until the person in question reaches the age of 28.
all such laws in any state depend upon there being a valid child support in affect and the individual circumstances.

the other spouse may, as an option, file charges in court for payment - and … you could be facing "contempt of court" if one still fails to pay the debt.
jail time could be a possibility for non-payment, too.

what is the statute of limitations on collecting child support in kansas?
if there is already a court order for child support in place, there is no statute of limitation.
the other parent pays until paid in full regardless of the age of the child(re … n).
if there's no court order, you need to file for support and, also, ask the court to award you retroactive support, for the time the other parent hasn't paid and you were supporting your child(ren) without any support.
word of advise, you need to ask the court for retroactive support, it is not awarded automatically.
good luck.

the first battle of bull run was one of the first major battles that resulted in large armies facing one another and serious bloodshed. it shattered the union's hope of winning the civil war quickly and easily.
the first battle of bull run (also known as the first battle of manassas, july 21, 1861) the first battle of bull run was a major wake up call to the north.
union forces were routed by beuregards forces.
it was an indication that this would be a long and bloody war and would require new leadership and improved training to prepare the federal troops for sustained action in the field.

what was the importance of the second battle of bull run?
the battle of 2nd bull run, or 2nd manassas in confederate terminology, was important for a number of reasons.
first, as far as strategic concerns, it essentially forced a co … nclusion to the union forays into virginia in 1862.
having routed pope and preventing his link-up with the bulk of mcclellan's army of the potomac, lee firmly grasped the initiative in northern virginia.
flush with victory and aware that the federals were scampering back to washington in disarray, lee was now able to take the fight to northern territory.
thus freed, lee marched into maryland on a brief campaign culminating in the battle of antietem (sharpsburg to the men in butternut and gray).
aside from the strategic consequences, the battle was also a watershed event in the developing narratives concerning the quality of leadership of the two respective combatants.
in brief, it served as a catalyst for robert e. lee's reputation for genius, while simultaneously epitomizing the bungling efforts of early federal army-level generalship.
defying common military doctrines of the time, lee took the calculated gamble of splitting his army in the face of a superior enemy (when considering the combined might of the armies of virginia and potomac), executing a daring wide-flanking manuever with stonewall jackson's wing of the army of northern virginia, while occupying mcclellan's front with longstreet's wing.
in coming to this decision, lee drew upon the appreciation of his assets (his trust in his subordinates stonewall jackson and james longstreet being paramount) and his sagely understanding of the limitations of his opponents (george mcclellan's overbearing caution in handling the army of the potomac on the penninsula and lee's general disdain for the skills of pope's command as examples).
he gambled he could unite his wings of the army and deliver a crushing blow to general pope before mcclellan could respond.
the gamble paid off, and pope was sent scurrying back across bull run, in little better accord than irving mcdowell's forces who contested roughly the same field the prior summer.
for his part, pope played the role lee envisioned perfectly.
pope committed error after error in the campaign, starting with questionable orders to the troops and culminating in a somewhat bizarre refusal to recognize the realities of the field (namely, the presence of longstreet's wing on his left flank).
at least lincoln quickly recognized pope's shortcomings and removed him from such a prominent position of authority in the eastern theater, sending him off to combat tribal uprisings in the upper mid-west.
unfortunately, this left lincoln none other than george mcclellan to command the forces in the east.
but that's another story.

with virginia almost entirely clear of union troops, lee now felt confident in invading the north and establishing credibility for the confederacy, so that british approval would take the form of actual military aid.

leukocyte esterase
definition
leukocyte esterase is a urine test to look for white blood cells and other signs associated with infection.
alternative names
wbc esterase
how the test is performed
a clean catch urine sample is needed.
see: urine specimen - clean catch
how to prepare for the test
no special preparation is necessary for this test.
how the test will feel
the test will involve only normal urination, and there is no discomfort.
why the test is performed
leukocyte esterase is a screening test used to detect a substance that suggests there are white blood cells in the urine, which may mean you have a urinary tract infection.
this test is part of the routine urine dipstick test.
if this test is positive, the urine should be examined under a microscope for white blood cells and other abnormalities associated with infection.
normal values
a negative test result is normal.
normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories.
some labs use different measurements or test different samples.
talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.
what abnormal results mean
an abnormal result indicates a possible urinary tract infection.
special considerations
the following may create a false positive result:
vaginal secretions (such as blood or heavy mucus discharge)
trichomonas infection (such as trichomoniasis)
false negative tests can be caused by:
high levels of protein
high levels of vitamin c

what is information processing cycle?
information processing cycle of computer can be well described by the following points: (1) input, (2) processing, (3) output and (4) storage input-entering data into the comp … uter.processing-performing operations on the data.output-presenting the results.storage-saving data, programs, or output for future use.1.
inputthe collection of raw data from the outside world so it can be put into an information system.
putting the acquired data into the information system.
examples: the payroll clerk collects workers' timecards so she knows how many hours each person worked that week and types the hours from the timecards into a spreadsheetconducting a survey of customer's opinions and then scanning the survey cards with a card reader.collecting jokes for a joke book and typing jokes into a word processor.using a form on a website to collect visitors' opinions typical input devices: keyboards, mice, flatbed scanners, bar code readers, joysticks, digital data tablets (for graphic drawing), electronic cash registersdogg anal is also known as, a program.
it interprets computer program instructions and processes data.
cpus provide the fundamental digital computer trait of programmability, and are one of the necessary components found in computers of any era, along with memory and input/output facilities.
a cpu that is manufactured as a single integrated circuit is usually known as a microprocessor.
beginning in the mid-1970s, microprocessors of ever-increasing complexity and power gradually supplanted other designs, and today the term "cpu" is usually applied to some type of microprocessor.
microprocessor (cpu) integrated circuit, also called a chip.
the brain of the computer composed of: alu: arithmetic logic unit: processor controller high speed calculator intel is the most popular chip categorized by model numbers higher model number=newer/faster chip speed of cpu is determined by clock speed higher the clock speed, faster the computer speed is measured in megahertz (mhz) megahertz: clock speed of the processor (100 mhz = 100 million cycles/second).
memory or ram next most critical element of a processing hardware is ram, often referred to as "primary storage" or "main memory".
random access memory (ram) receives and temporarily stores data and program instructions from the cpu this data bank communicates with the cpu, constantly exchanging information and constantly changing as long as the computer is on ram is an active, electronic state.
when the power is on, ram retains data.
when the computer is turned off, all data in ram is erased unless you have saved it to some mass storage device.
each time the computer boots, the computer goes through it's startup routine and lastly loads operating system instructions into ram random access memory (ram) is the workhorse behind the performance of your computer.
working as a foot soldier for your processor, ram temporarily stores information from your operating system, applications, and data in current use.
this gives your processor easy access to the critical information that makes your programs run.
the amount of ram you have determines how many programs can be executed at one time and how much data can be readily available to a program.
it also determines how quickly your applications perform and how many applications you can easily toggle between at one time.
simply put, the more ram you have, the more programs you can run smoothly and simultaneously.
to determine how much ram you need, factor in the demands of the applications you want to run simultaneously as well as the operating system (512 mb of ram is recommended by microsoft as minimum for operation of windows) then keep in mind that you'll inevitably add new applications and create new files, and add accordingly.
ram: (random access memory): (click here to read "how stuff works - ram") types of ramdram (dynamic ram) this is the most common type of computer memory.
dram needs refreshing and is refreshed hundreds of times each second in order to retain data.
during recharging it cannot be accessed by the cpssram (static ram) sram is approximately 5 times faster (and twice as expensive, as dram).
it does not have to be constantly refreshed.
because of its lower cost and smaller size, dram is preferred for the main memory, while sram is used primarily for cache memory.sdram (synchronous dynamic ram) is the standard memory offering in the pc industry and is faster than dram because it's synchronized to the system clock. .
it is designed for mainstream home and business applications, email, and basic audio and video streaming.
it provides single-channel memory and is available on our mainstream and value desktop system.ddr sdram (double data rate synchronous dynamic ram) takes all the features of ordinary sdram and increases the frequency bandwidth to improve system performance and speed.rdram (rambus dynamic ram) is able to load a new stream of data before the previous stream has completed, resulting in faster access speeds.
the rdram memory features dual-channel processing which doubles data throughput to further enhance performance.
this type of memory is optimized for high-end multimedia tasks involving video and audio.
dual channel rdram is shipped on our performance desktop systems powered by pentium 4 processorsvram: memory designed for storing the image to be displayed.cache ram is a small block of high-speed memory located between the processor and main memory and is used to store frequently requested data and instructions.
when the processor requests data, it will check in the cache first understanding the relationship between cpu and ramthe hierarchical arrangement of memory storage in current computer architectures is called the memory hierarchy.
it is designed to take advantage of memory locality in computer programs.
each level of the hierarchy is of higher speed and lower latency, and is of smaller size, than lower levels.
the memory hierarchy in most computers is as follows: processor registers - fastest possible access (usually 1 cpu cycle), only hundreds of bytes in sizelevel 1 (l1) cache - often accessed in just a few cycles, usually tens of kilobyteslevel 2 (l2) cache - higher latency than l1 by 2× to 10×, often 512 kib or morelevel 3 (l3) cache - higher latency than l2, often several mbmain memory (dram) - may take hundreds of cycles, but can be multiple gigabytes.
access times may not be uniform.

outputin information processing, output is the process of transmitting the processing information essentially, output is the presentation of any data exiting a computer system.
this could be in the form of printed paper, audio, video.
in the medical industry this might include ct scans or x-rays.
typically in computing, data is entered through various forms (input) into a computer, the data is often manipulated, and then information is presented to a human (output).
typical output devices: monitorspixels: images are created with dots of lights called picture elements, or pixels.
more pixels = higher resolution.
resolution is the maximum number of pixels the monitor can displaybasic vga is a pixel grid 640 x 480super vga is 1,024 x 768a video card, (also referred to as a graphics accelerator card, display adapter, graphics card, and numerous other terms), is an item of personal computer hardware whose function is to generate and output images to a display.printerslaser - laser beams bond toner to paperink jet - fine stream of inkdot matrix - pins & ribbonwhat else can you think of?

storagestorage, or mass storage refers to various techniques and devices for storing large amounts of data.
the earliest storage devices were punched paper cards, which were used as early as 1804 to control silk-weaving looms.
modern mass storage devices include all types of disk drives and tape drives.
mass storage is distinct from memory, which refers to temporary storage areas within the computer.
unlike ram memory, mass storage devices retain data even when the computer is turned off.
the smallest unit of storage is a file that contains such data as a resume, letter, budget, images or any one of the thousands of items that you may have saved for future reference.
additionally, files can be executable program files, or system files reserved for the operating system.
mass storage is measured in kilobytes (1,024 bytes), megabytes (1,024 kilobytes), gigabytes (1,024 megabytes) and terabytes (1,024 gigabytes).
examples of some mass storage devices disk storage - hundreds of thousands of cycles latency, but very large floppy disks: relatively slow and have a small capacity, but they are portable, inexpensive, and universalhard disks : very fast and with more capacity than floppy disks, but also more expensive.
some hard disk systems are portable (removable cartridges), but most are not.tertiary storage - optical storage: unlike floppy and hard disks, which use electromagnetism to encode data, optical disk systems use a laser to read and write data.
optical disks have very large storage capacity, but they are not as fast as hard disks.
examples: cd, cd-r, cd-rw, dvd or dvd-rtapes: relatively inexpensive and can have very large storage capacities, but they do not permit random access of data.flash memory - faster than disk storage, with up to 4gb or more of data, transferring (usually) over universal serial bus (usb) poonam valera gujrat jamnagar p_aum_k@yahoo.co.in

what is the relationship between the four functions of a computer system and how information is processed?
the four computer functions are: - data input -data processing -data storage and -data output the relationship between these and processing is that when data is ente … red into a computer,that is input, then the computer fetches it,decodes it executes it and results are stored in the cpu registers or even the user can choose to store to any other storage media.therefore,the four functions of a computer are stages of information processing.

hernando de soto in georgia
in 1539, the spanish explorer hernando de soto landed along the coast of modern-day florida and began heading north.
by the beginning of 1540, they had marched through florida and entered into the coastal plain region of modern-day georgia.
de soto and his army of men wanted one thing as they moved through georgia: gold.
as de soto and his men moved northeast through georgia they encountered native tribes who had been living in the region for thousands of years.
these native people had never seen a white man before, nor had they ever seen the huge animals that the white men rode on (horses).
these strange white men wore glimmering, shiny clothes (armor) which could not be pierced by bows and arrows.
the spanish also carried steel weapons such as swords and guns.
even though the native americans outnumbered the spanish, the weapons of the spanish were no match for the guns and swords of the spanish.
hernando de soto's march through georgia resulted in the death of thousands of native americans.
his soldiers killed the native people left and right as the spanish invaded their land and demanded gold and food.
many of the native people died from the diseases the spanish unknowingly brought with them.
de soto's expedition marched all the way through georgia, into south carolina, west through tennessee and parts of kentucky, over to alabama and into mississippi.
his expedition was considered by many to be a failure because he did not find any gold or treasure.
most of his army was killed because of starvation or sickness.
hernando de soto died somewhere along the mississippi river.
he is famous for being the first european to explore the southeastern part of the united states and for changing the lives of the native americans forever.

metaphysical guide of hematite, physical properties of hematite
hematite
hematite, also spelled as hæmatite, is the mineral form of iron (iii) oxide (fe2o3), one of several iron oxides.
hematite crystallizes in the rhombohedral system, and it has the same crystal structure as ilmenite and corundum.
hematite and ilmenite form a complete solid solution at temperatures above 950°c.
hematite is a mineral, colored black to steel or silver-gray, brown to reddish brown, or red.
it is mined as the main ore of iron.
varieties include kidney ore, martite (pseudomorphs after magnetite), iron rose and specularite (specular hematite).
while the forms of hematite vary, they all have a rust-red streak.
hematite is harder than pure iron, but much more brittle.
maghemite is a hematite- and magnetite-related oxide mineral.
huge deposits of hematite are found in banded iron formations.
grey hematite is typically found in places where there has been standing water or mineral hot springs, such as those in yellowstone national park in the united states.
the mineral can precipitate out of water and collect in layers at the bottom of a lake, spring, or other standing water.
hematite can also occur without water, however, usually as the result of volcanic activity.
clay-sized hematite crystals can also occur as a secondary mineral formed by weathering processes in soil, and along with other iron oxides or oxyhydroxides such as goethite, is responsible for the red color of many tropical, ancient, or otherwise highly weathered soils.
the name hematite is derived from the greek word for blood αἷμα aima because hematite can be red, as in rouge, a powdered form of hematite.
the color of hematite lends it well in use as a pigment.
the english name of the stone is derived from middle french: hématite pierre, which was imported from latin: lapis hæmatites, which originated from ancient greek: αἱματίτης λίθος (haimatitēs lithos, blood-red stone).
ochre is a clay that is colored by varying amounts of hematite, varying between 20% and 70%.
red ochre contains unhydrated hematite, whereas yellow ochre contains hydrated hematite (fe2o3  h2o).
the principal use of ochre is for tinting with a permanent color.
the red chalk winning of this mineral was one of the earliest in history of mankind.
the powdery mineral was first used 164,000 years ago by the pinnacle-point man obviously for social differentiation.[4]
hematite residues are also found in old graveyards from 80,000 years ago.
near rydno in poland and lovas in hungary, palaeolitic red chalk mines have been found that are from 5000 bc, belonging to the linear pottery culture at the upper rhine.
rich deposits of hematite have been found on the island of elba that has been mined till the time of the etruscans.
hematite's popularity in jewelry was at its highest in europe during the victorian era, and has since seen a strong resurgence in north america, especially in the western united states
hematite is present in the waste tailings of iron mines.
a recently developed process, magnetation, uses huge magnets to glean waste hematite from old mine tailings in minnesota's vast mesabi range iron district.
hematite on mars:
the spectral signature of hematite was seen on the planet mars by the infrared spectrometer on the nasa mars global surveyor ("mgs") and 2001 mars odyssey spacecraft in orbit around mars.
the mineral was seen in abundance at two sites on the planet, the terra meridiani site, near the martian equator at 0° longitude, and the second site aram chaos near the valles marineris.
several other sites also showed hematite, e.g., aureum chaos.
because terrestrial hematite is typically a mineral formed in aqueous environments, or by aqueous alteration, this detection was scientifically interesting enough that the second of the two mars exploration rovers was targeted to a site in the terra meridiani region designated meridiani planum.
in-situ investigations by the opportunity rover showed a significant amount of hematite, much of it in the form of small spherules that were informally named "blueberries" by the science team.
analysis indicates that these spherules are apparently concretions formed from a water solution.
physical properties of hematite:
color: steel gray, metalic gray, black, rusty red
rarity: very common
fun fact: in ages past hematite was used as a mirror.

why do why have day and night?
because the earth cirles around the sun spinning and when are part of the world is in day then we are facing the sun but when its night were facing away from the sun.
or … the hole world cant be facing the sun at the same time unless the world was flat.
answer   the sun going around the earth   answer   the rotation of the earth and where the sun hits it  
how do you get night and day?
the earth orbits the sun whilst it is spinning on it's axis, so one part of the earth is light (facing the sun), whilst the other part is dark (not facing the sun.)

because the rotation of earth on its axis we get day and night by the earth spinning on its axis, to get day the earth faces the sun we have day when the earth keeps rotating … we at last get night when the earth faces away from the sun.
we get day and night because of the earth's rotation on its axis.

why do we have night and day?
the earth constantly spins on its axis.
so,the other half of the earth is facing the sun , the other side is not.
this is how we have night and day.
it also matters on your ti … me zone.
the earth has 24 time zones.
some will be at night and some will be at day.

why is there day or night?
as earth rotates, different parts of it will face the sun (day); the rest will be dark (night).
the tilt of earth's axis is why there are different amounts of light and darkne … ss during the different times of year.

why are night lights on day and night?
some aren't.
it depends which nightlight you have.
some use a photovoltaic cell to turn off if enough light is detected.
other use a timer system.
those that don't do eith … er and are on all day and night are probably just cheaper, but then again, most nightlight have such a low power consumption that it really doesn't mater either way.

am is before 12 in the middle of the day and after 12 in the middle of the night, so it is both.
how much of both depends on the time of year as in the summer days are longer … then in the winter.

how do you have day and nights?
well the moon revolves around the earth and the earth revolves around the sun. so the earth rotates on its imaginary axis causing day and night from being turned away from the … sun or towards the sun also causing sun rise and sun set. hope i helped!

why are the differences in the ph of the mouth stomach and small intestine important for digestion?
the saliva need to be gentle enough at 7 ph to make foods small  enough to swallow safely.
the stomach needs to have strong acidity,  at a 1 or 2 ph, to break down proteins … into amino acids.
the small  intestine is where almost all of the absorption of the smaller  portions are absorbed into the blood.
the normal ph of the blood is  close to 7 so the ph of the small intestine is 7.4.

what is the ph scale of the mouth and why?
the ph of the mouth is slightly basic (about 7.4).
this is because an enzyme called salivary amylase that breaks down carbohydrates can only work in a slightly basic con … ditions.
if the ph was drastically reduced by means of acid (coke and other sodas) not only will amylase denature, but the bacterias that are living in your mouth will start to rot your teeth.

how long should a scholarship essay be?
most scholarship instructions tell you exactly how many words your essay should be.
be sure to not go over the required word count!

how long should an essay be?
as long as you need it to be!
there is no magic formula which states "x words = 1 paragraph" or "x sentences = 1 paragraph" write your topic sentence, then write as many para … graphs as you need to write in order to completely and properly explain that topic, then write your conclusion.
and that's how long your essay should be!

how long should the conclusion of an experiment be?
it doesnt have tobe very long, only about as big as the hypothesis - - - - - - - - - - about 2 paragraphs - make sure you include everything you need to - the results, why … you think the results came out like they did, do they match your prediction (if you did one), how you could improve next time, and anything else you've been asked to include

what should be in an essay conclusion?
well, in an essay you are basically saying the same thing over and over again.
so this is a basic essay: intro: give them a basic overview of what you are going to tell them.
… body: tell them. conclusion: give a basic overview of what you just told them

does a conclusion should be base on the essay?
a conclusion should be based on the essay or writing topic you wrote, because if it is not based on the essay, it would be off topic.
it should not repeat info previously stat … ed, and it should not pose questions.
this is an example of a good conclusion based on a essay written about the book, the outsiders.
reading this book provoked me, because i now realize discrimination and humiliation can have disastrous effects.
i think that no one should go through the same pain as the greasers did, and that no one should be segregated because of class difference; after all, we all are human.

what is think aloud
think-alouds have been described as "eavesdropping on someone's thinking."
with this strategy, teachers verbalize aloud while reading a selection orally.
their verbalizations include describing things they're doing as they read to monitor their comprehension.
the purpose of the think-aloud strategy is to model for students how skilled readers construct meaning from a text.

think-alouds
think-alouds have been described as "eavesdropping on someone's thinking."
with this strategy, teachers verbalize aloud while reading a selection orally.
their verbalizations include describing things they're doing as they read to monitor their comprehension.
the purpose of the think-aloud strategy is to model for students how skilled readers construct meaning from a text.
when to use:
before reading
during reading
after reading
how to use:
individually
with small groups
whole class setting
more comprehension strategies

why use think-alouds?
it helps students learn to monitor their thinking as they read and improves their comprehension.
it teaches students to re-read a sentence, read ahead to clarify, and/or look for context clues to make sense of what they read.
it slows down the reading process and allows students to monitor their understanding of a text.
how to use think-alouds
begin by modeling this strategy.
model your thinking as you read.
do this at points in the text that may be confusing for students (new vocabulary, unusual sentence construction).
introduce the assigned text and discuss the purpose of the think-aloud strategy.
develop the set of questions to support thinking aloud (see examples below).
what do i know about this topic?
what do i think i will learn about this topic?
do i understand what i just read?
do i have a clear picture in my head about this information?
what more can i do to understand this?
what were the most important points in this reading?
what new information did i learn?
how does it fit in with what i already know?
give students opportunities to practice the technique, and offer structured feedback to students.
read the selected passage aloud as the students read the same text silently.
at certain points stop and " think="" aloud"="" the="" answers="" to="" some="" of="" pre-selected="" questions.
demonstrate how good readers monitor their understanding by rereading a sentence, reading ahead to clarify, and/or looking for context clues.
students then learn to offer answers to the questions as the teacher leads the think-aloud.

this website explores the use of the think aloud strategy with poetry.
see example >
differentiated instruction
for second language learners, students of varying reading skill, and younger learners
have students do think-alouds in large or small groups; teacher and other students monitor and help.
ask students do think-alouds individually, and then compare with others.
students can write their own commentary.
complete, or have students complete, think-alouds orally, in writing, on an overhead, with post-it notes, or in a journal.

children's books to use with this strategy
abe's honest words by doreen rappaport , illustrated by kadir nelson (hyperion)
a straightforward overview of lincoln's life is punctuated by lincoln's words and commanding images.
additional resources for further reading and research are included as are sources used in this unforgettable book.
clementine's letter by sara pennypacker , illustrated by marla frazee (hyperion, 2008)
impetuous clementine is concerned that she'll lose her much loved 3rd grade teacher, mr. d'matz, when he's recommended to study in egypt for a year.
clementine cooks up a letter to assure that mr. d'matz doesn't get the fellowship.
humor abounds in this third book about spontaneous, likeable, and ultimately honorable clementine.
martin's big words: the life of dr. martin luther king, jr. by doreen rappaport , illustrated by bryan collier (jump at the sun/hyperion)
martin luther king jr. grew up fascinated by big words.
he would later go on to use these words to inspire a nation and call people to action.
in this award-winning book, powerful portraits of king show how he used words, not weapons, to fight injustice.

5 steps of composite risk management?
the 5 steps include: identify the risk, access, make decision,  implement controls and evaluate.
starting a new project can be  daunting, but with proper risk management you … can anticipate  challenges and solve them in advance.
what are the 5 steps of composite risk management?
five step composite risk management process   step 1:   identify hazards to the force.
consider all aspects of current and  future   situations, environments, and … known historical problem areas.
step 2:   assess hazards to determine risks.
assess the impact of each hazard  in   terms of potential loss and cost based on probability and severity.
step 3:   develop controls and make risk decisions.
develop control measures  that   eliminate the hazard or reduce its risk.
as control measures are  developed, risks   are re-evaluated until the residual risk is at a level where the  benefits outweigh   the cost.
the appropriate decision authority then makes the  decision.
step 4:   implement controls that eliminate the hazards or reduce their  risks.
ensure the controls are communicated to all involved.
step 5:   supervise and evaluate.
enforce standards and controls.
evaluate  the   effectiveness of controls and adjust/update as necessary.
ensure  lessons learned   are fed back into the system for future planning.

what are the 2 primary levels of the air force risk management?
the two primary levels of the air force risk management are fiscal and moral.
there is a fiscal responsibility to enhance the bottom line with sound safety practices, and a m … oral obligation to protect lives and the environment.
which air force risk management process involves the five step process and is used when there is sufficient time to plan an event?
the deliberate process is the 5 step process used by the air force.this process is also used when there is time to plan for the riskor event.
all air force risk management pro … cesses involve the 5-step process.the steps are establishment of standard, fixation of the standard,comparing actual performance with standard performance, finding outthe deviation, and correcting the deviation. deliberate

z score table
random variables are classified as discrete and continuous random variables.
while the discrete variables can assume only countable number values, a continuous random variable can assume values only as intervals between two values.
their distribution curves are bell shaped and termed as approximately normal.
the probability of a continuous random variable assuming a value in the given interval is proportional to the area of the distribution in the given interval.
theoretically the normal distribution curve can be used to study many variables that are approximately normal.
the normal distribution function has the equation
f(x, $\mu$, $\sigma^2$) = $\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}exp(\frac{-1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2)$
even though this equation is rather intimidating, in actual practice tables or technology is used for specific problems rather than the function itself.
the formula tells the two parameters that determine the function are the mean of the distribution indicated by the greek letter $\mu$ and the standard deviation of the distribution denoted by $\sigma$.
standard z score table
back to top
given below is a z-score table which can be used as a reference.
we will learn more about z - score table with some good examples.
you can also find help from an expert tutor, who can help you understand the basics.
standard normal distribution
back to top
in statistics, a data is analyzed for various study.
a standard normal distribution means the items in the data are normally distributed.
in all such cases, the mean is taken as 0 and the standard deviation is taken as 1.
in case of normal distribution, it is possible to convert any value to standard normal distribution table by knowing how many standard deviations is the number from mean of the data.
the number of standard deviations from the mean is defined as the z score and is calculated by the formula
z = $\frac{(x – m)}{s}$ , where ‘x’ is the selected item, ‘m’ is the mean and 's' is the standard deviation.
statisticians worked out and formed a table of z scores for different standard deviations.
this table is called ‘z score table and it is very helpful to find more information on the data.
the z score table also plays an important role in determining probability details.
z score table normal distribution
back to top
a standard normal distribution table shows a cumulative probability associated with a particular z-score.
the following bell shaped figure describes a normal distribution of a data.
it is seen that 68% of the area of the entire curve is covered within one standard deviation.
it implies that, 68% of the data is covered within 1 standard deviation from the mean.
similarly, it can be seen that about 95% of the data is covered within 2 standard deviations from the mean.
thus it gives rise to the fact that the z score value is nothing but the fraction of the data for that particular z value.
the necessity of z-score table
back to top
the normal distribution curve is symmetric about the mean.
the cumulative area corresponding to the interval is taken as the probability of the variable assuming a value in the interval.
it was noted that tables can be used to find the areas representing the probabilities for normal distribution.
since the position and shape of normal curves vary, this would mean we require a table for each variable.
to simplify this situation, the statisticians use standardized normal distribution, and hence the z –score table.
if x denotes the normal variable used in the problem then z-score represents the corresponding variable in the standardized distribution.
the mean and standard deviation of a standardized normal distribution are 0 and 1.
the formula used for transformation into z-score is
$z = \frac {value - mean} { standard deviation}$ = $\frac { x - \mu} {\sigma}$ where $‘ \mu’$ and $‘ \sigma’$ are parameters of the original distribution.
z score is the number of standard deviations the variable x is away from $ \mu $.
z score conversion table
back to top
given below is a z score conversion tables used for commonly used tests
z-scores (z), percentile ranks (pr), standard scores (ss) (mean = 100, s.d. = 15),  scaled scores (ss) (mean = 10, s.d. = 3).
positive z score table

given below is the full z score table which can be used for many z score related problems.
steps involved in finding the area using the z-score table
back to top
given below are the steps for finding the area using the z-score table
calculate the z-score using the formula, $z = \frac {x- \mu} {\sigma}$ round the answer to the hundredth (two decimals)
note the absolute value, by ignoring the sign.
read the z value with the first decimal on left most column and move along the row to match the column showing the value in the second decimal place.
note down the area given inside the table.
solved example
question: find the area corresponding to $z = 2.33$ in the z-table.
solution:
the z score till the first decimal is $2.3$, read $2.3$ on the extreme left column of the table move 4 columns along the row counting 0.00, 0.01,0.02 and 0.03.
read the area given in the cell, which is 0.4901.
hence the area corresponding to z = 2.33 is 0.4901.
due to symmetry the area corresponding to z = -2.33 is also 0.4901.
$z-score \to area\ reading\ in\ z-score\ table \to probability required$
after finding the z score using the formula, the corresponding interval in which the variable z falls will be diagrammatically represented.
the region satisfying the inequality will be shaded.
the area of the shaded region will be the required probability.
we saw the steps of finding the area represented in the z-score table corresponding to a z score.
the procedure for determining area of the interval is explained aided with diagrams.
how to find the areas using z-score table?
back to top
the method of finding the area using positive z-score table is explained here.
you will be wondering â€œdon't we need a negative z score table as well?â€.
the symmetry property of the normal curve makes it possible to handle the problems only with positive z-score table.
z score table examples
back to top
given below are some of the examples on z score table.
solved examples
question 1: the test scores of students in a class test has a mean of 70 and with a standard deviation of 12.
what is the probable percentage of students scored more than 85?
solution:
the z score for the given data is,
z = $\frac{85 – 70}{12}$ = 1.25
from the z score table the fraction of the data within this z score is 0.8944.
this means 89.44% of the students are within the test scores of 85 and hence the percentage oof students who are above the test score of 85 = (100 – 89.44)% = 10.56%
hence, the required probable percentage is 10.56%.
question 2: an organization made a survey on the monthly salary of their clerical level employees, in dollars.
the data revealed the mean as 4000 with a standard deviation of $600.
find what percentage of employees are in the salary bracket [3000, 4500].
solution:
the z score of the employees with a salary less than 3000 = $\frac{3000 - 4000}{600}$
= - 1.67 (approx)
the z score of the employees with a salary more than 4500 = $\frac{4500 - 4000}{600}$
= 0.83 (approx)
from the z score table, the fraction of the data within,
z score of -1.67 = 0.0475
z score of 0.83 = 0.7967
therefore, the fraction of data between the z scores of -1.67 and 0.83 = 0.7967 – 0.0475 = 0.7492
hence, 74.92% of clerical level employees are within the salary bracket [3000, 4500].

why do ears bleed?
some people are greatly troubled when they experience bleeding in their ears.
they would initially think that something is very wrong and would immediately consult the doctor (which is the best thing to do).
bleeding of the ears can mean something is ‘terribly wrong, or it is just a normal occurrence and not a cause for concern.
there are reasons why our ears bleed and the most common reason for it is ‘when we clean our ears using q-tips,.
when we remove earwax in our ears, it could create an itching sensation.
due to this sensation, you will be scratching your ear a little more aggressively to relieve yourself from the itch.
this method actually irritates your ears and would make the itch more severe.
aggressive scratching may cause your ear canal to bleed and it may cause infections.
the other reason for the bleeding is called trauma.
trauma in the ears refers to the ‘chapping, or bleeding of the ears due to accidents like concussions and the likes (which involves damage or fracture around the head).
bleeding in the ear caused by scratching is another form of trauma.
there are severe infections in the ears that may cause it to bleed.
some of these infections are otitis externa, otitis media, chronic otitis media and the worst case scenario the development of a tumor.
consulting a doctor or an ear specialist is the best option that you can choose when you experience a bleeding of the ear, ‘just to be on the safe side,.
heed is advice and recommendations about the cause of the bleeding.
make sure you have a definite grasp about the reason why you experience the bleeding.
if treatment is necessary, you should do it as soon as possible.
this would lessen the risk of the infection to develop into something more serious as time passes by.

what were hitler's philosophies?
hitlers hatred of the jews and a number of other groups sprang from the fact that he saw them as being in the way of the ultimate progress of the nation of germany.
this is on … e reason why he implemented euthanasia on those he believed were mentally defective.
the philosophy of nietzsche who taught about the ubermensch which some translate as 'superman' influenced hitler in some of his ideas and was one reason he hated christians and jesus in particular for being weak in allowing himself to be crucified.
other philosophical thinking which influenced him was the philosophy which led to eugenics, namely the idea that some were more highly evolved than others and that the unfit should be eliminated.
this policy which was also being used and developed in the us at the same time was borrowed by him and used for his particular purposes.
the ideas of eugenics of course have their roots in the thinking of some of those who followed darwin and the theory of evolution.
although these philosophies were not original with him, he applied them rigorously, consistently, and ruthlessly - this latter trait being one common thread to both above mentioned philosophies.
nietzsche downplayed the role of feelings in the development of the ubermensch and the idea of the development and improvement of the master 'aryan race' was also not to be hindered by sentimentality.
thus, although they were not 'his', he made them his own as part of his own political and military philosophy of hatred.
to achieve his ends hitler, as a shrewd politician, made use of growing resentment in germany over the reparation agreement from ww1 and thus gained the sympathy of many.
the sense of national humiliation which he sought to overturn by refusing to pay and his not so secret military build up, followed by his eventual re-occupation of the rhineland all were aimed at building german pride and nationalism.
it would seem that these were important tools in terms of his former stated ideas in that it gained him the power he needed to achieve them.
he was thus a shrewd pragmatist as well.
yes, i think it's fair to say he wasn't a fan of jews.

it depends on the sound the vowel makes.

why did you where uniform?
when speaking of uniform, we will easily think of those armed forces and paramilitary organizations such as police, emergency services, security guards.
uniforms are used to h … elp present a good image to the public.
another common uniform is work uniform.
when employees wear an identifiable work uniform, they become instantly recognizable to consumers.

it turned into a … slaughter, and when president bush senior observed the slaughter on television, he ordered his commanders to stop all offensive operations!

a jewish-american rabbi living in israel, studying, teaching and writing on judaism.
the possible palestentians, samaritans owned that land first.
so it was about land really.
when the jews came from egypt they were converted to the monotheistic religion, and then that made the samaritans barbarians.

religion or money, ie. land.
answer:
according to jewish sources (2 kings 17:24), after the assyrians exiled the israelite ten tribes, the assyrian king brought non-jews from cutha, babylonia and syria (hamat), and settled them in the depopulated area where the ten tribes had lived (samaria).

there was enmity between the people of samaria and the jews because the jews conquered samaria during the maccabean. therefore they were despite by jews and became outcasts.

why do the jews hate samaritans?
if you are referring to the biblical reference found in st. john 4, "jews have no dealings with the samaritans", then the answer is as follows: when god originally delivered …
israel from egyptian bondage he called them into relationship with himself as a people.
one of the criteria or stipulations of his relationship with him was that they would not have any dealings with or take wives from the surrounding heathen nations (that is those nations that worshiped "other" gods), (false gods).
due to israel's continuous sin and compromise of their relationship with god, ii kings 17:7 israel is sent into captivity as a form of divine judgment for her sin.
southern kingdom of israel (judah), is taken by babylonians into babylonian captivity.
northern kingdom of israel, (israel) is taken into assyrian captivity.
during their assyrian captivity, some of the men of israel against god's command, took wives of the assyrians.
the descendants of these unions are identified in the new testament as "samaritans".
to the jew they represented that which was outside of the will of god, hence their refusal to engage in relations with them.
alongside this the samaritans in history were instrumental in challenging israels resettlement and rebuilding after being released from assyrian/persian and babylonian captivity.
the jews saw their land not only as property legally belonging to them, but a divine promise and covenant between themselves and god.
the opposition of the samaritans to their covenant inheritance brought great tension between the samaritans and themselves.
why did the jws hate the samaritans?
the jews hated the samaritans because the samaritans were jews that intermarried with gentiles.
they considered them not equal and a lower caste.

why did people hate the ancient samaritans?
generally, the ancient samaritans were hated by the jews and the greeks.
to the jews, greeks were "gentiles", meaning that they were not jews.
therefore, they were polytheisti … c (they believed in more than one god) and unclean.
to marry a gentile would be a heinous crime in the jewish community.
samaritans were generally jews and greeks that were intermarried.
once this was found out, both individuals (the jew and the greek) would be cast out of their own communities, forcing samaritans to build their own towns and cities.
to sum it up, a jew would be hated for marrying a gentile for the above-listed reasons, and greeks would also be hated for marrying out of their polytheistic religion.

were samaritans thought of as sinners by the jews?
yes, but not only samaritans but publicans and harlots too.
please see: luke 18.
10 two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a pharisee, and the other a publican.
… / 11 the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, god, i thank thee, that i am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
matthew 21.:32 for john came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him please note how much the jews despised samaritans by their words to jesus: john 8:48 then answered the jews, and said unto him, say we not well that thou art a samaritan, and hast a devil?
further thoughts: it was more than just a case of sinning.
there was a long period of contention between jews and samaritans, based on many factors.
god's command to the 12 tribe kingdom of israel was for them to worship in jerusalem (1 kings 11:32).
when the tribes split into two sections(10 tribes under king jeroboam and 2 under king rehoboam), jeroboam set up apostate worship in samaria (1 kings 12:25-31) .
the term 'samaritan' came to mean the descendants of those who practiced the apostate 'samaritan religion' (john 4:9)(1kings 12:28-33; 2kings 17:7-17; 2chronicles 11:13-15; 13:8+9) (2kings 17:24-41) as time went on, there were other clashes between the two groups(ezra 1:3; 2:1+70)as the samaritans prevented the rebuilding of the temple in jerusalem (ezra 4:1+2)(ezra 4:3-24), and again the repairing of jerusalem's walls(nehemiah 2:19+20; 4:1-12; 6:1-15)(nehemiah 13:6,7+28).
the samaritans erected a temple on mount gerizim (in samaria) around 4 bce, in competition with the temple in jerusalem, and this division existed until the days of jesus.
he used this split as part of a few of his illustrations when he taught on earth (john 4:20-23)(john 8:48)(luke 10:29-37).

how did samaritans differ from most jews?
a:  ethnically, the samaritans (or samarians) are believed to have been  a mixture of various, mainly semitic races, including the remnants  of the israelites who were not … deported by the assyrians in 722 bce  or fled into exile at that time.
the israelites are now known to have been polytheistic right up  until the final destruction of their kingdom in 722 bce, as were  the immigrants whom the assyrians brought in to replace those who  had left.
however, the samaritans of the time of jesus practised an  archaic form of judaism, believed to have been introduced by king  josiah of judah during his expansion into samaria.
in spite of  this, the jews did not regard the samaritans as true jews.
christian answer:   following a, roughly, three-year period of rebellion and assault by  the assyrians... the house of israel (ten tribes) was defeated,  removed and carried away from their land -- and the "half-brother"  tribes of judah disappeared from world view and history...
scattered among the gentile nations in the world.
the assyrian king replaced the israelites with gentile peoples from  all around.
and the samaritans ceased to be the "half-brothers" of  the jews.
they were now "gentiles," to be shunned and avoided by  jewish law.
"therefore the lord was very angry with israel, and removed them  out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of judah only."
(ii kings 17:18)   these were the "samaritans" extant in jesus' day... rejected and  shunned by the jews.
for centuries, no longer their "brothers" --  but "unclean gentiles" whom jesus made into a spiritual object  lesson in his "good samaritan" parable [a parable that left a bad  taste in the mouths and jealousy in the hearts of those jews who  heard him tell it].
jewish answer:   according to jewish sources (2 kings 17:24), after the assyrians  exiled the israelite ten tribes, the assyrian king brought non-jews  from cutha, babylonia and syria (hamat), and settled them in the  depopulated area where the ten tribes had lived (samaria).
they  were taught judaism by one of the jewish priests (2 kings 17:27),  and they were taught the torah, which they wrote in the old hebrew  script.
the talmud relates how the samaritans adopted some of the mitzvot  (torah-commands) but not others (talmud, berakhot 47b), how they  denounced the jews to alexander in an unsuccessful attempt to get  him to destroy the newly-built second temple (talmud, yoma 69a),  and how they interfered with the declaring of rosh hodesh (the new  moon) (talmud, rosh hashanah 22b).
our traditions relate how the  samaritans would waylay the jews who tried to journey to the holy  temple.

are the samaritans a mix of assyrians and jews?
biblical detail: when assyria conquered an area, they might  repopulate the land with people from other conquered nations.
this  was the case when samaria was overthrown.
2 kings 17:22-24 - for the children of israel walked in  all the sins of jeroboam which he did; they did not depart from  them, until the lord removed israel out of his sight, as he had  said by all his servants the prophets.
so israel was carried away  from their own land to assyria, as it is to this day.
then the king of assyria brought people from babylon, cuthah,  ava, hamath, and from sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of  samaria instead of the children of israel; and they took possession  of samaria and dwelt in its cities.

were samaritans once jews?
a:the samaritans, or samarians, came from the province of samaria, formerly the hebrew kingdom of israel before its destruction in 722 bce.
the samaritans would have been of m … ixed race, descendants of the original israelites and the immigrants whom the assyrians brought in to replace the israelites who had been deported.
thus, they shared a common hebrew heritage with the jews.
although polytheistic or perhaps at this stage henonistic, the israelites had shared belief in the same chief god with the jews, who lived in judah to the south.
at some stage after the babylonian exile of the jews, the samaritans adopted a monotheistic version of judaism and accepted a version of the torah as scripture.
they rejected other books of the jewish scriptures.

the process of leaf color change
leaves change color during the autumn because the amounts of pigments change as the leaves prepare to fall from the trees.
all leaves gradually lose chlorophyll during the growing season, and this loss accelerates before leaf fall.
under optimal conditions this process of chlorophyll loss is very orderly and allows the plants to resorb much of the nitrogen in the structure of the pigment molecule.
carotenoid pigments are also lost from the plastids during aging, but some of them are retained in the plastids after the chlorophyll is removed; this produces autumn leaves with yellow colors.
in unusual cases, sometimes in winterberry holly, a fair amount of chlorophyll is left in the leaves when they fall.
such leaves are a pale green in color, or perhaps yellow-green from the mixture of chlorophyll and carotenoids.
most interesting are leaves that turn red, because this color is the result of the active synthesis of anthocyanin pigments just before the leaves fall from the trees.
this is the most common color of autumn leaves; about 70 % of shrubs and trees at the harvard forest produce anthocyanins during the senescence of the leaves.
in these leaves, the actual shades of red are the consequences of the amounts of anthocyanin, the retention of carotenoids (or even a little chlorophyll).
anthocyanin and chlorophyll produce brownish colors.
anthocyanins and carotenoids produce orange hues.
in some plants the color production is quite uniform, as in hobblebush or blueberry.
in other plants, leaves vary between individuals (as sugar maples) or even dramatically within an individual (as red maples), or even within a single leaf (red maples).

yes, the word 'poor' is an abstract noun, a plural, uncountable noun; a word for people of little means in general.
example sentence: the government has many programs to help the poor .
the abstract noun form for the adjective poor is poorness.
a related abstract noun is poverty.
another answer:
to answer the original question: poor is not any type of noun.
it is an adjective.
to deal with the comments about what is and what is not an abstract noun: concrete nouns refer to things that are perceivable through the senses.
thus, in the examples given above, music is a concrete noun, not an abstract noun, as it is perceived with the senses (hearing).
so is noise .
meeting is also concrete.
for example: 'i haven't missed any meetings of the photographic society this year.' (the meetings are perceived through the senses of sight and hearing, and possibly others.)
abstract nouns are not normally countable.
it is more common to say, for example, 'he experienced many different kinds of happiness during the next few years' than 'he experienced many different happinesses ...'

is you an abstract noun?
no, the word you is not a noun, it's a pronoun, a word that  takes the place of a noun in a sentence.
the pronoun you is the second person, which takes the place of … the  name of the one spoken to; used for singular or plural; used as a  subject or an object; for example:    john, you can pick me up at five.

what is definition of physics?
the study of interaction between matter and energy!
physics is the science of matter and its motion, as well as space  and time.
it is the science that deals with c … oncepts such as force,  energy, mass, and charge.
as an experimental science, its goal is  to understand the natural world.

what is the definition of physics?
some people would call it 'natural philosophy'.
my dictionary says 'a branch of science concerned with the nature and properties of matter and energy.
the subject matter … of physics is distinguished from chemistry and biology, includes mechanics, heat, light and other radiation, sound, electricity, magnetism and the structure of atoms.'
this is a controversial question with no unique answer, but here's my take on it:     physics is the study of energy.
in particular, an undergraduate physics curriculum has six general subjects:   1) mechanics   2) electricity & magnetism   3) optics   4) thermodynamics   5) quantum mechanics   6) relativity

what is the features of the high definition video?
hd video is a television standard that contains approximately 5 times the amount of data as standard definition television signals.
hd is formatted as either 1080 line or 720 … line.
both line counts are hd. 1080 line signals can be interlaced or progressive scan.
(interlaced requires two fields, or passes of the display, to fully update the image, progressive fully updates on every field) frame rates can be 23.98, 24, 25, 29.97, 50 or 59.94 frames per second depending on the region or the type of content.
hd signals in the studio are always digital whereas sd signals can still be processed as analog.
domestic equipment carries hd only on hdmi connectors.
new equipment does not support hd on analog interfaces to reduce unauthorized copying of material.
hd is always 16 : 9 aspect ratio (wide screen).
in comparison, sd can be either 4 : 3 or 16 : 9 although wide screen sd is largely confined to european markets.

what is the definition of social features?
social features are personalities of yourself explained and told socially; so if i were to say my hair color is turquoise with british accent that tells you that i am british … and it is what people found out about me by talking to me. but social features are tricky because anything you say has to be personalities "pecked" at you not things... for example lets say that i say my favorite color is brown this is not a social feature of myself because saying my favorite color is brown does not tell you anything that describe me all it tells you is that my favorite color is brown and that does not give you any description or background information of me. all in all social features are pieces of personality thrown at you verbally perhaps by the way someone may be speaking.

the intermolecular force in ccl4 is dispersion forces.
this occurs when slight variations in electron distribution effect the electron distribution of other molecules.
because ccl4 is non polar, it does not have other intermolecular forces holding the molecules together.

what are intramolecular forces?
an intramolecular force is any force that holds together the atoms making up a molecule or compound.
there are three main types of intramolecular forces:   - ionic  …
-covalent   - metallic   ionic intramolecular forces   these forces exist between atoms of ionic compounds (molecules formed by transfer of electrons).
it is the force of attraction between the cation (positively charged atom) and anion (negatively charged atom) in a molecule.
covalent intramolecular forces   these forces exist between covalent compounds (molecules formed by sharing of electrons).
it is the force of attraction between the bonded pair od electrons with the nucleii of the the two atoms

which is stronger intramolecular forces or intermolecular forces?
intramolecular forces are the forces within a molecule or between atoms or different parts of a molecule.
intermolecular forces are the forces between two molecules.
it is … normally said that intramolecular forces are stronger because they involve chemical bonding and that is certainly correct.
the energy necessary to break chemical bonds typically dramatically exceeds the energy associated with forces between to distinct molecules.
one occasionally hears the term intramolecular forces being used to refer to the interaction between two different parts of a large molecule, such as two segments of a protein.
when the chemical bonding of adjacent atoms is not included in the discussion of intramolecular forces, then the general statement that they are stronger than intermolecular forces is no longer true.
the details of the molecules and atoms and the nature of the forces will determine the strengths. intramolecular intramolecular b/c dealing with hcl it takes way more energy to break h and cl bond than to separate 2hcl molecules(intermolecular)
how do you figure out what the intramolecular forces in an atom are?
you can't for an atom. im guessing you mean a molecule :).

what is molar mass?
complex answer: molar mass is the sum of the masses of all the atoms in a compound.
molar mass, is a physical property characteristic of a given substance (chemical element o … r chemical compound), namely its mass per mole of substance as grams per mole (g/mol or g mol â1 ), especially in chemistry.
a mole is another unit of measurement.
it is the quantity of anything that has the same number of atoms found in 12 grams of carbon-12.
that number is avogadro's number, which is usually stated as 6.022 x 10 23 .
simple answer: it is the amount of a substance in moles.

what is the molar mass of kclo3?
alls you do to find a molar mass is add up all of the atomic masses.
potassium=39.09 chlorine= 35.453 oxygen(3)=15.999.
so kclo3 would equal 271.65g to a mol?
then i think to … find the number of atoms of each you would take the atomic mass * avacodo's number so it would be for example chlorine. 1gcl(35.453/1)(6.022*10^23/1) however i might be wrong on that part.

what metal has a mass of 158g and a volume of 20ml?
what your tutor wants here is to find out is if, from the information given, you can determine the nature of the metal.
which you should be able to do.
you should first determ … ine the specific gravity, the weight in grams per cubic centimetre.
and then explore the metals you know of to find one with similar density. 158 / 20 = 7.9 g/cc.
(or since there are 1000 000 cc in a m3, multiply by 1 000 000.) which gives us 7.9000 tonnes/cubic metre.
in a list of density of the elements, iron comes in at 7.87 tonnes per m3.
which for the present purposes looks a good candidate.

moukhtara ( arabic : المختارة ‎) is a small town in the chouf district of the mount lebanon governorate of lebanon .
the town's inhabitants are mostly druze, with a christian minority.
it is the hometown of walid jumblatt , the leader of lebanon's progressive socialist party .
it is also an ancient archaeological site, excavated in 1963 by jacques cauvin who found an abundance of flint tools.
examinations were conducted on 378 artifacts with finds including daggers, arrowheads, sickles, axes, chisels, picks and awls traced to the neolithic horizon. [1]
james mellaart suggested that heavy neolithic tools and weapons found at the site were "not associated with pottery , and possibly earlier than the pottery neolithic of byblos ."

there are few reasons humans cannot live underwater.
the main reason, of course, would be that humans lack gills.
the gills in fish and other underwater organisms allow the oxygen in the water to be used inside the body.
oxygen is very fundamental to our body; for it keeps us and our cells alive and functioning.
another reason is that in salt water (the ocean), if we did have gills and consumed the water, our cells will lose all of their water because they of the hypertonic environment and they will shrivel up.
we can't live under water because our lungs don't take in water they take in air, if we don't have air in our lungs then we could not function right!
were not fish lol :)

why can't humans see underwater?
light rays bend when they enter from one medium to another of different density.
the amount of bending is determined by the refractive indices of the two media.
if one medium … has a particular curved shape, it functions as a lens.
the cornea, humours, and crystalline lens of the eye together form a lens that focuses images on the retina.
our eyes are adapted for viewing in air.
water, however, has approximately the same refractive index as the cornea (both about 1.33), effectively eliminating the cornea's focusing properties.
when our eyes are in water, instead of their focusing images on the retina, they now focus them far behind the retina, resulting in an extremely blurred image from hypermetropia.
what would happen if humans had to live underwater?
we would have to have gills

why can't humans live on pluto?
this is a write-up i had to do for school on why we shouldn't live on pluto, even if we had the technology to. hope it helps :).
why not to live on pluto.
in my opinion, peo … ple should not live on pluto.
there are many reasons for why i think this, a few of them being the size, the temperature, the light, and the food..
pluto is so small, that if people were to colonize it, there would be no space!
people wouldn't be able to have their own yard (not that they'd want one on pluto) and everyone would be very cramped up.
now, you might say, well not everyone from earth is going to live on pluto.
but, although this is true, it is most likely that the majority of people will go live on pluto.
this is because it is new, and adventure, and everyone would think it was great, so everyone would go there.
and then everyone would be disappointed because they wouldn't be able to walk without running into someone..
the next problem is the temperature.
although we may have the technology to live on pluto, it doesn't mean that the technology would be ideal.
for example, would you like to wear a space suit everyday?
you would have no choice of what to wear, and it would be a pain having to go to the washroom!
plus, to keep our houses warm, we would have to use an enormous amount of energy to even get our houses to freezing point!
think of all the pollution!
our earth has gotten polluted from only using our heaters in certain countries, at certain times of years.
think about how much pollution there would be if every house had its heater on everyday cranked up 1000 times the amount that it usually is!
some people would say, you could use a better type of energy, for example, solar energy.
the problem with that is, there is no sunlight on pluto!
pluto would be so incredibly dark, that there is no way you could get any sunlight to heat up your home with.
which leads me on to the next problem..
there is no natural light on pluto.
it is so far away from the sun that it barely gets any of the sun's heat, or light.
again, there would be a problem with the electricity.
not only would we have to light our homes, we would most likely need to light the streets!
otherwise, we would just live in the dark, we wouldn't be able to see outside, and there would be no walking the dog, going for a run, playing hockey on the street, or anything like that, because we wouldn't be able to see.
all outdoor sports would be finished.
it is possible though, that you could use technology to build huge lights that would light up great amounts of space outside.
but, think of how much energy that would use!
and you wouldn't be able to get it from any hydro lines, because there is no water, rivers, or waterfalls.
also, there would be no fossil fuels, because there are no plants or animals discovered that have lived on pluto, to fossilize.
the only possible source of energy is wind, but that is very select, because what if it wasn't windy?
you wouldn't be able to see.
so you could only go outside on windy days.
and, that's a bit unfortunate, because windy days on pluto are very windy., so would you really want to be inside anyways?
therefore, having no light would be a serious issue with living on pluto..
the last issue would be the food.
obviously fruits and vegetables would not be able to be grown on pluto.
also, unless animals were somehow shipped to pluto, and were kept in a heated building, we would also have no meat.
therefore, the only way to get food to people living on pluto would be to take it by a spaceship.
this would be kind of hard, considering it takes many years to get there, and all the food would go bad in a couple of days.
this means the only food we would really be able to eat would be canned items that won't go bad too fast, like canned pasta, beans, or packaged foods like dry pasta, and chocolate.
therefore, we would not be getting a variety of food and would become unhealthy fairly quickly.
also, what would we drink?
there is no water on pluto, and milk goes bad really easily.
so, the only thing we could do would be to ship soda and pop across the universe, and that is not healthy!
so therefore, people living on pluto would get no nutritional food..
these are the reasons that people should not live on pluto.

fish are able to breathe underwater why can't humans?
generally speaking, fish have gills which are specialized to bring blood close to the surface in thin membranes that allow oxygen to pass through to the blood.
human lungs can … 't pull oxygen out of water, we need oxygen in air.
now, the mechanics of why we can't pull oxygen out of water might be chemical (myoglobin attracts oxygen in human blood, perhaps fish have a better system).
besides air vs. water, we also need oxygen at certain concentrations, if you go too high in elevation or altitude, you can't breathe because there isn't enough oxygen to support what your using.
breathing and drinking are two different things.
to drink is to digest a liquid and use its benefits.
breathing is taking in oxygen in some way and using it for bodily functions within your cells.
we cannot breathe under water like a fish because our lungs require oxygen.
fish have gills and their gills allow oxygen to be extracted from water.
we don't have gills hense we cannot breathe underwater..

nuts and seeds
nuts and seeds provide a powerhouse of nutrition
seeds and nuts are popular foods in many diets, often as snacks, but in most vegetarian eating plans, they are staples.
these nutrient-dense powerhouses provide protein, fiber, healthy fats, enzymes and a number of vitamins and minerals.
they can be eaten whole, in “butters” or used to replace meat in many recipes.
nut creams and nut milks can be used to make sauces or in smoothies.
keep them cool
store seeds and nuts in a cool, dry place in an airtight container.
since nuts and seeds have a high unsaturated fat content, they are subject to turning rancid if not handled properly.
nuts in the shell will keep longer than shelled nuts, but they are not as convenient to use.
in the raw
whenever possible, the best way to eat most nuts and seeds is raw, since they retain the highest level of enzymes and other nutritional value that way.
however, roasted nuts can still be nutritious, especially if you roast them yourself with a minimum of added fat and salt.
raw nuts may be easier to digest than roasted ones due to the enzymatic activity of raw foods.
interesting fact about nuts and seeds: cashews are generally not eaten raw due to a toxic substance in the oil of the shells that can get into the nuts.
roasting solves this problem, so cashews are usually eaten roasted.
the cashew tree is in the same family as poison ivy, and the oil in the shells of cashews may have the same effect as poison ivy does on some people.
grind as you go
seeds should be purchased whole and ground fresh, since they begin to deteriorate as soon as they are ground and are more likely to become rancid that way.
you can use a small coffee grinder to grind seeds, as needed.
although “meal” made from ground seeds is available, whole seeds that you grind yourself are a better choice.
varieties of nuts and seeds that can form part of a healthy diet:
almond –an oval-shaped nut that, in its sweet form is popular as a snack, as a flavoring, as part of cereals and as an ingredient in recipes, especially desserts and garnishes; readily available in more forms (in-the-shell, shelled whole, sliced, slivered, blanched and paste) than any other nut; high in protein, fiber and minerals, particularly calcium, and a good source of b vitamins; related to peaches, cherries and plums.
--caveat for nuts and seeds: there is also a variety of almond called “bitter almonds” that are toxic when eaten.
since, as the name implies, they have a bitter taste, you are not likely to confuse the two, should you actually eat a bitter almond!
the oil from bitter almonds can be used for non-edible purposes.
-almond recipe idea: to add extra flavor, texture and nutrition, garnish salads, green vegetables, casseroles, or hot cereals with sliced almonds.
brazil nut – a large, high-fat nut, native to the amazon region; grows in clusters and has a hard brown shell; rich in minerals such as selenium.
for more information on selenium, click here.
fun fact for nuts and seeds: brazil nuts have so much fat in them, they will burn like little candles when lit!
they are hard to light, and you probably wouldn’t want to waste a good nutritious food in this way, but in a pinch, who knows?
actually, the empty pods of brazil nuts are often filled with wax and sold as candles, which seems a much wiser use of resources.
-brazil nut recipe idea: you can use sliced brazil nuts in place of, or along with, water chestnuts in recipes or to add crunch to salads.
you can also make nut butter from brazil nuts by combining 1 and 1/2 cups nuts with about 4 tablespoons of oil in your food processor.
you may add some good quality salt to taste, if you wish.
cashew – a tan-colored, half-moon shaped nut; native to south america; not sold in the shell due to a toxic irritant in the oil of the shells; eaten roasted rather than raw; higher in carbohydrate and lower in fat than other nuts; rich in protein, minerals, b vitamins and fiber.
fun fact for nuts and seeds: cashews grow on a tree and are really the “seed” of a type of “apple” fruit that is very popular in areas of south america where they grow.
however, this cashew apple is so perishable that it can only be enjoyed fresh from the tree and thus cannot be shipped to other parts of the world.
-cashew recipe idea:   cashews may be used to make nut butter by combining 1 and 1/2 cups nuts with about 4 tablespoons of oil in your food processor.
you may add some good quality salt, to taste, if you wish.
chia seed – a tiny seed that was popular in ancient times, but is regaining popularity as a “super food”; may be black or white in color; high in omega-3 fatty acids; facilitates calcium absorption; high in fiber.
- chia seed recipe ideas: sprinkle one tablespoon chia seeds on yogurt, cereal, soups, salads, even ice cream.
make a gel from chia seeds plus water (8:1 ratio), stirring mixture after one minute and refrigerating it up to two weeks.
use gel to replace half of the fat in baked goods, such as muffins, cookies, brownies and pancakes or add to yogurt, puddings, etc. to increase nutrition without changing flavor.
click here for more information on chia seed.
interesting fact about nuts and seeds: chia seeds were widely used in ancient times by the aztecs in central america.
although their efficacy as an energy food was undeniable, according to one account, the european conquerors sent some home to spain, but they did not catch on as a food with the spanish people of that time.
coconut – fruit of the tropical coconut palm tree; “meat” and “milk” are used for food; oil is used both in edible products such as baked goods, and inedible products such as soap; good source of vitamins and minerals; considered a “super food” by some alternative health practitioners; oil from the coconut is one of the few plant oils that is saturated.
- coconut recipe ideas : add unsweetened, grated coconut to breakfast cereals, yogurt and baked goods for extra nutrition, texture and flavor.
you can generally substitute unsweetened, grated coconut for sweetened coconut in cookie recipes, since there is usually enough sugar in the recipe already.
coconut can also be made into flour, which is gluten-free and can be used to replace part of the flour in baked goods.
keep in mind that coconut flour is more dense that other flours, so use sparingly to avoid a heavy finished product.
interesting fact about nuts and seeds: some health experts consider coconut as a “super food” due to certain properties it possesses.
since there is disagreement on this issue and since coconut does contain saturated fat with all its implications, we may have to wait for more research to be sure.
in the meantime, using natural, unsweetened coconut, a whole food, as part of your diet seems reasonable.
flaxseed – small golden or brown seed from the flax plant used as food as far back as ancient greece and rome; high in fiber and omega-3 oils; oil may be used as an omega-3 supplement for vegetarians instead of fish oil; excellent source of lignans, fiber that helps lower cholesterol.
- flaxseed recipe idea : freshly ground flaxseed can be sprinkled on cereal, salads and used to replace up to 1/2 cup flour in recipes for baked goods such as breads, muffins, cookies and pancakes.
interesting facts about nuts and seeds: the flax plant, a plant with blue flowers, is used to make linen fabric.
it is the seeds that are used for food, and which have recently attained the status of “super food” in some circles.
click here for additional information about flax seed.
hazelnut (filberts) – small round, reddish-brown nut, widely grown in europe and asia; high in mono-unsaturated fats;good source of minerals and vitamins a, b and e; also called cobnuts.
peanut – not really a nut, but a legume; as a food they are used more like nuts in butters and for snacks; good source of the b vitamin, niacin; provide protein and energy; grow underground; member of the pea family.
interesting fact about nuts and seeds: african americans first made peanuts popular in the south, and in fact, peanuts are often called “goobers”, which comes from an african kikongo word, nguba.
it has been suggested that peanuts replaced cotton as a cash crop in the south when the cotton crop was devastated by the boll weevil pest.
-peanut recipe ideas : peanuts can be used in main courses as well as desserts.
click here for peanut butter fudge recipe.
pecan – native north american nut with thin, smooth brown shell and lobed “meat”; related to walnuts and hickory nuts, with a richer flavor; good source of vitamin e, potassium and protein; may have cholesterol-lowering properties.
- pecan recipe ideas: add to cereal, salads, yogurt or smoothies for extra nutrition; may be used to make baklava.
pine nut – cream-colored, sweet-tasting seed from certain pine trees that grow in southwestern u.s and mexico; also called pignolia and pinon nuts; common in mediterranean diet; may be a digestive aid and appetite suppressant; good source of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals; also imported from europe and asia.
-pine nut recipe ideas: pine nuts are great on salads and are used in pesto sauces for italian dishes.
fun facts about nuts and seeds: pine nuts are the seeds hidden in the pine cones of pine trees.
they are popular with songbirds who harvest them from the pine cones with their beaks and even store them for future consumption.
sometimes these storage depots are not used and end up sprouting and producing new trees.
native americans also used pine nuts as a staple in their diet, often for grinding into flour.
pistachio – bright green nut with a buff-colored shell (sometimes dyed red); native to the europe and asia; popular as a snack and ingredient in sweets; rich in antioxidants and minerals; may have cholesterol-lowering qualities; member of the sumac family.
interesting fact about nuts and seeds: it used to be the practice to dye pistachios red to make them more attractive and uniform in color.
with better ways to pick and sort the nuts, this practice of dying them red has become less common.
no more telltale scarlet fingers from shelling pistachios!
pumpkin seed – flat, oval-shaped, green seed (covered with a whitish coat) from pumpkins; high in minerals, especially zinc; may contribute to prostate health and be anti-inflammatory; sometimes called pepitas.
fun fact for nuts and seeds: many people buy pumpkins to use the flesh for pies, etc., but throw away the seeds.
however, the seeds can be roasted for a tasty, nutritious treat.

how long can king cobras grow to?
the king cobra averages about 3.6 to 4 meters or 12 to 13 feet.
however, the record size for wild king cobras is one found in thailand, that was 5.6 meters or 18.5 feet. …
the record for a captive was in london zoo which was 5.7 meters or 18.8 feet.
so they can get pretty big, although the previous stated are the records for how long.

what is normal uterine time for involution
involution (medicine) - wikipedia
involution (medicine)
from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
jump to: navigation , search
involution refers to the shrinking or return of an organ to a former size.
at a cellular level, involution is characterized by the process of proteolysis of the basement membrane (basal lamina), leading to epithelial regression and apoptosis , with accompanying stromal fibrosis .
the consequent reduction in cell number and reorganization of stromal tissue leads to the reduction in the size of the organ.
contents
1 examples
1.1 thymus
1.2 uterus
1.3 mammary gland

3 references
examples [ edit ]
thymus [ edit ]
the thymus continues to grow between birth and puberty and then begins to atrophy , a process directed by the high levels of circulating sex hormones .
proportional to thymic size, thymic activity ( t cell output) is most active before puberty .
upon atrophy, the size and activity are dramatically reduced, and the organ is primarily replaced with fat .
the atrophy is due to the increased circulating level of sex hormones , and chemical or physical castration of an adult results in the thymus increasing in size and activity.
[1]
uterus [ edit ]
involution is the process by which the uterus is transformed from pregnant to non-pregnant state.
it is a physiological process occurring after parturition ; the hypertrophy of the uterus has to be undone since it does not need to house the fetus anymore.
this process is primarily due to the hormone oxytocin .
mammary gland [ edit ]
during pregnancy until after birth, mammary glands grow steadily to a size required for optimal milk production.
at the end of breastfeeding , the number of cells in the mammary gland becomes reduced until approximately the same number is reached as before the start of pregnancy.

in a normal functioning person this would occur if the glucose levels fall below a certain point (hypoglycemic).
diabetics can go low because this hormone is not released... along with insulin, which comes from the beta cells.
insulin acts as a "key" and allows sugar to go into the cells throughout the body.
when insulin is not produced your sugar levels rise and you become hyperglycemic.

malfunction of the hormonal secretion of the pancreas?
the most important hormone secreted by the pancreas is insulin : this is produced by cells in areas in the organ known as the islets of langerhaans, and passes into the blood, … and so around the body.
it is essential as it causes cells of the body to be able to absorb glucose from the blood, which is the energy-source for cellular activity (for example, muscle cells take up large amounts of glucose when they are being used in physical exercise; and cells in particular areas of the brain are seen to metabolize glucose when they are active).
the condition caused by a lack of insulin production is hyperglycaemia (abnormally high blood sugar concentration, which often occurs normally during pregnancy, but, if it reaches a certain level or persists outside pregnancy, is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. -->hyperglycaemia, if left untreated, can cause unconsciousness and death. -->diabetes mellitus gets its name from the latin word for sweet or honey-like : this is because the high levels of sugar in the blood leads to sugar being present in the urine.
historically, physicians would taste patients' urine as part of their examination, and the sweet taste led to this same.

are zendaya and tom holland dating?
posted by kathleen at july 14, 2017 16:28:39 july 14, 2017 16:28:39
at around 5pm eastern standard time yesterday, people reported that spider-man: homecoming co-stars zendaya and tom holland are dating.
at around 6pm eastern standard time yesterday, lainey sent me a link to this news and when i read it, i dropped my phone out of my hands (it didn’t break, thank the holy twins) and squealed like no grown woman ever should.
i’m extra.
say something.
by now, you probably know how we feel about zendaya here at laineygossip.
she is an impeccably-dressed , vogue-covering ray of sunshine who should be protected at all costs.
you also probably know how we feel about tom holland as spider-man. sarah called his performance “ remarkable.
” she and i have both fangirled repeatedly over tom and zendaya’s continued adorableness throughout the spider-man press tour.
if this couple is really happening, we care.
a lot.
according to people’s source, it all started on set of spider-man: homecoming :
“they started seeing each other while they were filming spider-man,” says the source.
“they’ve been super careful to keep it private and out of the public eye but they’ve gone on vacations with each other and try and spend as much time as possible with one another.”
the source also says that they bond over their shared ambition and sense of humour.
i would add that they also bond over their freakishly good dancing skills.
remember their epic lip sync battle episode ?
remember this video?
i realize that these two humans are only 20 and 21 years old, respectively, and i don’t want to put too much pressure on them but i’m going to need them to go ahead and get married and have babies.
before i get too excited, i should mention that both zendaya and tom holland responded to the dating rumours on twitter.
wait wait...my favorite is when it says we go on vacations together ha!
i haven't been on a vacation in years!😂😭🤣hbu @tomholland1996 ???

@zendaya does the press tour count 😂😝 https://t.co/2wsstzpyde
— tom holland (@tomholland1996) july 13, 2017
cute.
that’s not exactly a no though, is it?
both statements hint at a denial but neither of them actually say, “nah, this isn’t happening.”
so, it’s totally happening.
let me have this.
there are few things i love more than teen love (i know they are both in their twenties but they play teenagers on screen, ok) and black girls falling in love.
again, not to put too much pressure on tom and zendaya but this couple is essentially ripped from my dreams and i’m already obsessed with them.
their awkward teen angsty banter in spider-man: homecoming was my whole sh-t.
the spider-man franchise gave us kirsten dunst and tobey maguire (maybe).
it gave us emma stone and andrew garfield (definitely).
now, it has hopefully, maybe, probably given us tomdaya.
zenlland?

wondering how much your old "ike" dollar is worth?
read below to learn the value of a 1972 silver dollar.
the eisenhower dollar series   was created to commemorate the late president dwight eisenhower, with the first coins being produced in 1971.
all of the dollar coins produced for public circulation were made on a copper-nickel planchet, the same type used in u.s. quarters, dimes and half dollars.
a few special types of "ikes" were struck in a 40% silver alloy, and sold by the u.s. mint to coin collectors for a small premium.
in 1972, the u.s. mint produced the normal copper-nickel coin for circulation at two mint branches, philadelphia and denver.
denver mint coins can be recognized by the small 'd' mintmark directly above the coin's date.
these dollars are common, and are worth only $1-2 in any condition.
philadelphia coins can be identified by their lack of a mintmark.
while most of these coins are common as well, there is one notable 1972 philadelphia variety with a greater value.
the rare 1972 "type 2" design variety is worth upwards of $40 in all conditions.
type 2 dollars are identified by the details of earth on the reverse side.
next to the outline of florida, there are no distinguishable islands.
on the less valuable type 1 and type 2 1972 dollars, there are visible and distinct islands in the caribbean sea.
the picture below illustrates the difference: type 2 is on the far left, followed by type 1 in the middle and type 3 on the right.

max breitenbach has been collecting us, foreign, and ancient coins for over a decade, and has been writing about them for nearly as long!
max is a regular guest blogger on coinweek.com.
he is currently working on a collection of european silver crowns and is planning on finishing his us type set sometime within the next century.

to see a baby in your dream signifies innocence, warmth and new beginnings.
babies symbolize something in your own inner nature that is pure, vulnerable, helpless and/or uncorrupted.
if you find a baby in your dream, then it suggests that you have acknowledged your hidden potential.
if you dream that you forgot you had a baby, then it suggests that you are trying hide your own vulnerabilities; you do not want to let others know of your weaknesses.
alternatively, forgetting about a baby represents an aspect of yourself that you have abandoned or put aside due to life's changing circumstances.
the dream may serve as a reminder that it is time for you to pick up that old interest, hobby, or project again.
if you dream that you are on your way to the hospital to have a baby, then it signifies your issues of dependency and your desires to be completely care for.
perhaps you are trying to get out of some responsibility.
if you are pregnant in real life, then a more direct interpretation may simply mean that you are experiencing some anxieties of making it to the hospital when the time comes.�
to dream of a crying baby symbolizes a part of yourself that is deprived of attention and needs to be nurtured.
alternatively, it represents your unfulfilled goals and a sense of lacking in your life.
if you dream that a baby is neglected, then it suggests that you are not paying enough attention to yourself.
you are not utilizing your full potential.
alternatively, this dream could represent your fears about your own children and your ability to protect and to provide for them.�
to dream about a starving baby represents your dependence on others.
you are experiencing some deficiency in your life that needs immediate attention and gratification.
to see a dead baby in your dream symbolizes the ending of something that was once a part of you.
to dream of an extremely small baby symbolizes your helplessness and your fears of letting others become aware of your vulnerabilities and incompetence.
you may be afraid to ask for help and as a result tend to take matters into your own hands.�to dream that you are dipping a baby in and out of water signifies regression.
you are regressing to a time where you had no worries and responsibilities.
alternatively, such a scenario is reminisce of when the baby is in the fetus and in its comfort zone.
in fact, some expectant mothers even give birth in a pool, because the environment in the water mimics the environment in the uterus.
it is less traumatic for the baby as it emerges into the world.
so perhaps, the dream represents your search for your own comfort zone.
to dream that a baby is walking or dancing refers to the potential and possibilities that life has in stored for you.
the future looks bright.
the dream may also be a metaphor that you need to take baby steps in your relationship, toward your goal, in a work project or whatever undertaking.
if you have a baby in real life, then the dream is a reflection of your hopes for that baby.
to see a baby in your dream signifies innocence, warmth and new beginnings.
babies symbolize something in your own inner nature that is pure, vulnerable, helpless and/or uncorrupted.

if you are pregnant in real life, then a more direct interpretation may simply mean that you are experiencing some anxieties of making it to the hospital when the time comes.�<br />to dream of a crying baby symbolizes a part of yourself that is deprived of attention and needs to be nurtured.
alternatively, it represents your unfulfilled goals and a sense of lacking in your life.
if you dream that a baby is neglected, then it suggests that you are not paying enough attention to yourself.
you are not utilizing your full potential.
alternatively, this dream could represent your fears about your own children and your ability to protect and to provide for them.�<br />to dream about a starving baby represents your dependence on others.
you are experiencing some deficiency in your life that needs immediate attention and gratification.
to see a dead baby in your dream symbolizes the ending of something that was once a part of you.
to dream of an extremely small baby symbolizes your helplessness and your fears of letting others become aware of your vulnerabilities and incompetence.
you may be afraid to ask for help and as a result tend to take matters into your own hands.�to dream that you are dipping a baby in and out of water signifies regression.
you are regressing to a time where you had no worries and responsibilities.
alternatively, such a scenario is reminisce of when the baby is in the fetus and in its comfort zone.
in fact, some expectant mothers even give birth in a pool, because the environment in the water mimics the environment in the uterus.
it is less traumatic for the baby as it emerges into the world.
so perhaps, the dream represents your search for your own comfort zone.<br />to dream that a baby is walking or dancing refers to the potential and possibilities that life has in stored for you.
the future looks bright.
the dream may also be a metaphor that you need to take baby steps in your relationship, toward your goal, in a work project or whatever undertaking.
if you have a baby in real life, then the dream is a reflection of your hopes for that baby.

what does your dream mean if you had a baby in your dream?
well, it definitely depends on the dream.
but...here are some dreams and their meanings: just a baby: it means innocence and is saying there are new beginnings on the way!
on … the way to the hospital to have baby: it means that you want to be more dependent and don't like having the resposiblility of someone or something.
a crying baby: it means that there is a part of yourself that is being deprived of attention and needs nurturing.

it is impossible to interpret this dream without additional information.

what does it mean when you have a dream of seeing different people deliver their baby?
if you are a girl so maybe you're pregnant if you are a boy you might want to be a father, i think if you are a sexually active female of childbearing age, a pregnancy test … would certainly be a good idea.
but it is more likely that the pregnancies and deliveries represent ideas or projects being brought to completion.
one possible interpretation is that you feel that other people have accomplished their goals while you have not.
another interpretation could be that the different people represent different aspects of yourself, and you have several projects that need to be "delivered."
in that case, the dream represents your feelings of being overwhelmed.

what does it mean to see a down syndrome baby in your dream?
further information: i don't know what it means but my husband has a down syndrome brother and i've been seeing dreams of him like 4 times so far. i would love to know the mea … ning of this dream answer: your dream only illustrates your own anxiety about the down syndrome in your husband's family.
the dreams do not give you dependable information as to whether or not your husband's children could have down syndrome.
> medical science actually understands quite a lot about the genetic defects that cause down syndrome.
the wikipedia article attached below provides good information on these causes as well as explaining the tests that can determine whether or not any pregnancy is affected by downs.
> the more information you gather and the better you understand the causes of down syndrome, the less anxiety you will have.
knowing the tests and other options that are available to you should also be very helpful .

what does it mean when you dream you are pregnant and you can see the baby inside of you?
if the dreamer is a sexually active woman of childbearing age, a pregnancy test might be a good idea.
dreams can be influenced by changes within the body, particularly hormona … l changes.
alternatively, the dream could be about an idea, project or piece of work that the dreamer is developing.

what does it mean to see a happy baby in your dream?
this dream has many possible meanings depending on the dreamer and his/her situation.
if the dreamer is an expectant parent or the parent of a young child, this dream represen … ts the hope for a happy healthy child in years to come.
if the dreamer is an adolescent girl, the dream could reflect the hormones and changes preparing the girl for maturity.
yet again, the "baby" could represent something entirely unrelated, such as an important idea or project the dreamer hopes to develop.

the time to recharge batteries depends a) on what device you are referring to - laptop/ mobile phone/ mp3 player/ electric car... and b) most importantly, how low the battery … already is.
generally speaking, a few hours should suffice for the majority of batteries.
leaving them to charge overnight though may be a wise choice, to be safe.

how long does it take to recharge a battery from dead?
check and see how many ah (amper hours) your battery is.
if it is for a gas/gasoline car, then it is probably around 42 ah; batteries for diesel are usually around 72 ah.
chec … k the power of your battery charger.
it should be something between 4-6 a.
you must divide the battery capacity by the charger strength to get the time necessary.
for example: your battery is 42 ah and your charger is 6 a.
then the time needed will be 42 ah / 6 a = 7 h.
charge your battery no longer than 7 h.
please note that overcharging the battery permanently damages it.

can you just test the volts of a rechargable aa battery to see if it is charged properly?
the easiest way to do this is with an inexpensive voltmeter available from radio shack, fry's, amazon, etc.
the no-load voltage is only a little different from fully charged t … o nearly discharged.
depending on the exact battery you are talking about, the fully charged voltage might be about 1.28 or 1.3 volts, with a nearly flat battery reading 1.20 volts.
check your batteries when full and when nearly discharged and you will see the range.
a much more crude test is to place the battery in a single cell flashlight and observe the brightness and color of the light.

faq about how to keep snakes away from your yard
s nakes, the very word brings images of slithering reptiles to mind.
it can be very nerve wracking to step out into the yard to do some work when you've seen a snake in your yard.
if you have chickens, it can make you even more nervous, snakes love baby chicks and fresh eggs.
to make matters worse, the more vegetation you have in your yard, the more likely you are to have snakes.
and whilst most of these reptiles aren't venomous, a visit from a snake can scare chickens, other pets and also anyone else around.

remember, many of the above mentioned traps are not friendly for chickens.
be sure that if you're using a trap you keep it a safe distance from your chicken coop or make sure that it's safe for use around chickens.
all of the above mentioned in the table work well no matter if you're in the city or a rural or suburban area.
however, if you're living in a city you may not be able to use the vibrations as readily.
5 things you can do today to keep snakes away from your yard
- look your property over
snakes have preferences on where they live just like you do.
they tend to prefer tall vegetation with plenty of cover and lots of room to maneuver.
they also like to know that there is plenty of food in and around your yard.
snakes like eating rodents, insects and the like and they will take full advantage of your yard if you have any of these issues.
snakes also enjoy fresh eggs and baby chicks so be sure that the eggs and baby chicks are safe and secure from such predators.
tips to keep your yard snake free:​
avoid clutter in and around your yard.
if you have old vehicles that are no longer running get them removed
keep your yard mowed.
snakes like tall grass where there is plenty of cover and they can hide
​although snakes themselves are predators, they are afraid of predatory birds and other animals that are large
eliminate the habitat for other animals in your yard such as mice and rats and you've just eliminated the source of food for snakes
remember that to a snake, a chicken coop looks like a delightful smorgasbord of offerings.
make it a bit less enticing by cleaning up around the area and putting up some barriers to the snakes entry into the chicken coop.
pros:
this method works very well and puts the homeowner in charge of the situation.
easy to check and maintain
inexpensive to do
cons:
you must be vigilant and keep your yard maintained, remove clutter as it appears and be aware of your yards condition at all times.
if you're not able to do the work you'll have to hire someone to do it for you.
- chemical snake repellents
nature's mace snake repellent
there are also chemical snake repellents however, depending upon their composition, they may pose a health risk to pets and people as well as the environment.
be sure that repellents chosen are for snakes and always follow the instructions on the label.
in addition to using repellent, you'll have to be sure to follow the above instructions on the basement and your yard area.
keep in mind that many chemical snake repellents may be hazardous to your baby chickens.
use these well away from your chicken coop and plan to use another method to keep snakes away from the coop itself to protect your chickens health.
also keep your door sweeps and your window screens fitting properly.
be sure to cover other potential entries such as dryer vents, drains and other such openings to your home.
pros:
most repellents trigger avoidance in snakes because snakes don't like the scent or feeling of the repellent.
they will try to avoid it.
cons:
depending upon the repellent you use you may have to reapply it if it rains or if he scent fades easily.
always remember that snakes are simply seeking an easy meal.
your chickens and those fresh eggs will always be appealing to a snake so you'll want to ensure that you're taking care to protect your chicken coop from unexpected company as well as your yard.
- snake traps
image courtesy of amazon
there are two types of snake traps.
those that are lethal, and those that are not lethal.
lethal traps will grip the snakes body and kill the snake as it enters the trap head first
however, keep in mind as the snake slithers from one side to another the snake may be caught further down the body.
snake traps work very well, however, you'll want to set them up where they won't be a danger to your baby chicks or any of your chickens.
glue traps also work well.
they will hold the snake whether it's venomous or not until you are able to release it.
you can spray cooking oil onto the trap when you're ready to release the snake and it will be able to work itself free of the trap.
an important note is that snakes will actually help to keep insects and rodents out of your yard if you're having an issue with one type of predator consider what else may be going on that could be causing your issue.
pros:
these work well and are easy to set up.
they are relatively inexpensive.
cons:
however you're going to have to “empty” the trap when it's full so keep this in mind when you're approaching the trap.
if the snake is alive it may be a bit more challenging depending upon how the snake is caught in the trap.
remember, you can spray cooking oil spray on the glue to help the snake release itself so that you don't have to actually touch the snake, all you have to do is relocate the snake.
- snake fences
hardware cloth is a good inexpensive way to create a physical barrier to keep snakes out
how does a snake fence work?
snake fences are barriers that keep snakes from going underneath of buildings and inside of gardens.
they are made of materials that aren't easily moved and that don't have any large openings that the snake could squeeze through.
snake fences can work as an ideal barrier to keep snakes away from your chicken coop.
they offer a barrier that will help to protect the coop from such predators.
a popular choice is wire mesh as well as solid wood.
keep in mind that it doesn't take much room for a snake to squeeze through an opening.
thus, remember if you're using a fence, bury it several inches into the ground.
when the soil erodes due to weather be sure to keep an eye on the soil and the fence levels.
different regions may require different fencing materials.
some snakes are great climbers and the fencing may simply be a great climbing wall to them.
slope fences at an outward angle to help prevent snakes from entering into your yard or chicken coop.
snake fences also help to keep snakes out of swimming pools and pond areas.
pros:
these work very well to keep snakes out of your yard
cons:
you're going to have to remember to keep them in good condition.
if there is a breach in your fence you risk a snake in your yard or your chicken coop.
cost (there are a variety of fencing options and your cost will be dependent upon your choice in fencing materials.
if you have a large yard, garden, pond or pool you're going to have to build a fairly large fence.
- basement sealer
s2000 basement wall & floor sealer
the basement must also be sealed off to keep snakes out.
if you have damage around your foundation or basement you need to repair it immediately to avoid snakes.
be sure to locate your chicken coop away from such things as old foundations, basements and other structures that could lend themselves well to snake habitats.
if you have holes and cracks that will allow snakes into your home you're not going to be able to keep them out no matter how many traps you have set.
consider mortar to fill in cracks.
it will dry hard and rodents and snakes won't be able to enter that way.
consider expanding foam if you have long cracks or even foam sealants work well.
it's usually an accident if a snake winds up in a basement.
they much prefer to be able to get in and out of their den and it can be challenging for them to reside in your basement.
inspect your home several times each year to ensure that there are no openings that a snake could enter through.
pros:
this works very well as long as it's maintained.
cons:
you must revisit your foundation and ensure that new cracks or holes don't appear.
if they do appear you must seal them off quickly.
typically you'll have to check about three or four times per year to ensure that there aren't any potential snake entries to your home.
cost will be dependent upon materials used to seal off holes or cracks.
how to keep snakes away summary checklist
start by learning more about the snakes in your area
keep your yard free from clutter
keep your chicken coop clean and regularaly inspect it for snakes
choose lower growing plants over tall ones
remove water sources on the ground
rid your yard of pests (rodents, insects etc. that snakes like to feed on)
patch up holes in your yard, home and foundation
use sulfur powder around your home and yard
create vibrations that they don't like to repel them
faq about how to keep snakes away from your yard
- do some of these work better on different species of snakes?
none of the above mentioned methods seem to work better on any specific species of snake.
- does where i live matter with snake repellents?
if you're living in the city you may wish to avoid such methods as ultra sonic vibration.
however, all of the other methods can readily be used in and around your home even if you're in the city.
- i have read that mothballs work well, should i use them?
although the internet would have you believe that this is a great way to remove snakes, mothballs work best for keeping mice, bats, bats, groundhogs, raccoons, possums and the like from your yard.
while this eliminates some of the food sources for snakes, it does not eliminate all of them thus it's a waste of money and your time.
mothballs could also be poisonous to your chicken coop

how do you perceive the gospel?
okay first, i'm not a preacher and i have no credentials on the subject but, this is how i perceive the gospel.
it is an amazing history of mankind and offers great guidance f … or how we live our lives.
but, the gospel as we know it gideaon or king james versions are a result of the council of nicea formed by the roman emperor constantine when he made christianity the official religion of italy.
the council determined what gospels would and would not be included in the christian bible.
in other words they left some out.
over the years other gospels have been discovered and are hotly debated by the so called scholars.
so...for me the bible is an amazing document and i try to live by it's teachings but, i think men over time have tried to use it, and still do, for their own means.
just for fun, read genesis and find that god created woman twice. once from the dust as with adam and once from adam's rib.
there is a gospel that says the first woman was actually named lillith and that she was in league with the devil.
answerto personalize it, i'm not a preacher either, but i perceive the gospel as the very word of god.
joh 20:30 and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: joh 20:31 but these are written, that ye might believe that jesus is the christ, the son of god; and that believing ye might have life through his name.

answers.com ® is making the world better one answer at a time.
the name 'senior' clubs refers to the 'flex' in the shaft of the club.
clubs are grouped into the categories that denote how much the club shaft will bend, or flex, during the swing.
they are, in ascending order of strength, or stiffness: ladies, seniors, regular, stiff, and tour.
since older players typically don't generate the same club head speed as younger players, they require a shaft that bends slightly more than average during the swing.
the bend in the shaft creates more power by bending, or 'loading' during the downswing and then releasing this stored power at impact into the golf ball.
it's important each golfer have a club set that is tailored to his or her swing.
by measuring their average swing speed, they can chose the shaft that's right for their unique swing.
many amateurs mistakenly believe that by using senior shafts, they will gain added distance from the extra flex.
the opposite is true, since the faster swinger will cause the senior shaft to bend too much, and the release of stored power will occur after impact, causing a loss of both distance and accuracy.

what are the major differences between men's and women's golf clubs?
answer   women's clubs tend to be about 1 inch shorter.
the shafts also should be a little more flexible.
grips might be a little thinner, too.
other than that, it's pret … ty much just cosmetics.
on average, women probably should use a higher lofted driver, say 13 degrees or so, because with a slower swing speed more distance can be generated with higher loft.
(probably most men should, too, but that's another argument.)
answer by futurelpgagolfer   the major differences from men's and women's golf clubs is that women's golf clubs are more flexible and men's golf clubs are more stiff.
the grips are thinner for women and the grips are bigger for men.
women's clubs are lighter which helps generate speed and men's golf clubs are heavier which makes a hard impact on the ball.
women and men should have a lofted driver of 11 degrees.
women can be just as fast as men, probably even faster because they are more flexible to have a full body rotation.
i use 11 degrees and i go 210 yards.
and the ball goes very high with a 11 degrees but still good enough to go as far as possible.
what is the difference between iron golf club and wood golf clubs?
answer   woods are used for driving from the tee, while irons are used on the fairway.
the face of woods are angled less to provide more forward force, and the iro … ns are angled more provide more life and accuracy.
confusing matters is that many "woods" these days are made from metal alloys.
what is the difference between various wood golf clubs?
the driver is usually the starting club and can hit the farthest, all the others get a little less powerful with higher numbers.

whats the difference between mens and senior golf clubs?
there shouldn't be much.
older players often have a slower swing speed, so they should benefit from softer shafts, usually "a" instead of "r".
(although there's no strict defi … nition of what "a" and "r" mean.)
senior players also often prefer graphite shafts because they provide more shock damping than steel, so worn hands don't hurt so much from mis-hits.

what distance do you get from different golf clubs?
basically, drivers are used to hit the ball the farthest.
woods and irons are used for mid-range shots, and putters are used for short range.
utility clubs such as wedge … s are used for special situations like being in a sand trap.

what is the difference in shaft golf club?
some shafts are graphite, some are steel.
steel is used mostly in irons and is not as complicated as graphite.
graphite is used in woods and if not used properly, can hurt you … game.
graphite has different levels of stiffness for different swing speeds.
the faster you swing, the more stiffness you need.

the mla rules for citing us supreme court cases are as follows:
u. s. supreme court decisions
general rule: name of the first plaintiff and the first defendant, the number of the case, the name of the court that decided the case, and the date it was decided.
names of cases and court names are frequently abbreviated.
the following example refers to the william "sky" king versus st. vincent's hospital case decided by the u. s. supreme court in december, 1991.
standard mla format :* king v. st. vincent's hospital.
no. 90-889.
supreme ct. of the us. 16 december 1991.
(translation: short case name, docket number, court, exact date of decision)
*note: the mla now suggests using legal bluebook format for citations.
standard legal format : king v. st. vincent's hospital, 502 us 215 (1991)
the name of the petitioner and respondent, or case name, is italicized.
(translation: short case name, volume number, abbreviation for u. s. supreme court reports, decision starts on page indicated, year of decision.)
if referring to a specific page within the opinion, place a comma after the starting page number, then insert the referenced page number:
king v. st. vincent's hospital, 502 us 215, 220 (1991)
legal bluebook format : king v. st. vincent's hospital, 502 u.s. 215, 219 (1991) .
the name of the petitioner and respondent, or case name, is italicized.
(translation: short case name, volume number, abbreviation for u. s. supreme court reports, decision starts on page indicated, specific page being referenced, year of decision in parentheses, period.)
subsequent citations : king, 502 u.s. at 219.
(translation: case name is typically shortened to indicate the petition; however, there are a few situations - such as when the petitioner is a state or the united states, that could result in confusion - where the respondent's name is substituted.
when in doubt, look it up or ask for assistance.)

does a legal case automatically get heard by the us supreme court?
no, there is nothing automatic about any legal case being heard by the supreme court.
many cases are presented to the court by lawyers, but the court gets to decide which case … s it wishes to hear.
here is an interesting example.
the us no longer has a military draft, but it did have one for many years, and young men were compelled to serve in the military.
many people believed (and i still believe) that this was an unconstitutional practice, given that there is a constitutional amendment which specifically forbids any form of involuntary servitude.
yet the supreme court has always refused to hear any such legal challenges and has still never ruled on the constitutionality of the draft.
another view interestingly, charles t. schenck posed the same thirteenth amendment argument before he was arrested under the alien and sedition act of 1917 (schenck v.
united states, (1919)).
the constitution expressly allows congress to raise and maintain the military in article i, section 8, clauses 11-16, and the thirteenth amendment does not supersede this authority.
military conscription has never been considered unconstitutional.
to declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules concerning captures on land and water; to raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years; to provide and maintain a navy; to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces; to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions; to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the united states, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by congress;

you can collect from a 401k at any age; however, there are withdrawal penalties as well as tax penalties until age 59-1/2.
after 59-1/2 you will still have the penalty of it being taxable income, but the early withdrawal penalty goes away. the goal is to delay withdrawals until retirement when your taxable income normally drops somewhat, and even then withdrawal should be viewed closely to not exceed withdrawals that will negatively impact one from a taxable income standpoint.

what is a 401k plan?
a 401(k) plan is a "savings" plan that allows an employee to put aside money from his paycheck before any taxes are calculated on it.
in other words, there are no federal or s … tate taxes.
they are however subject to social security and medicare taxes.
the 401(k) plan is administered by the employer.
some employers match a portion of the amount the employee contributes to his own plan.
average match is about 3% of the employee earnings.
there is a limit each year for the amount that the employee can contribute.

why is a mile longer than a kilometer?
there is no reason.
the kilometre/kilometer is the decimal unit of length whereas the mile is the imperial unit of length that was originated in england and is still used in … the usa.
an english scientist proposed the decimal system but france originated the decimal system of measurement around 1791.
the metre was devised as 1/10 000 000 of the distance from the equator to the north pole.
it is now defined in terms of the speed of light.
the mile was inherited to the british from the romans and related to a 1000 paces.

is a mile longer than a kilometer and why or why not?
no, a kilometre is less than a mile.
it is, in fact, only 62% of a mile, as follows:     1 kilometre = 0.621371192237334 miles     there is no reason for this as … both units of measurement are human derived units of measurement.
the metric system is arguable the better system (over the imperial system) for 3 quite valid reasons:     1.
one unit of measurement for each physical quantity.
no matter from which other quantities of the si system derived, yields always the same unit.
2.
scalability by prefixes - combinations of prefix and unit make for a plethora of convenient combined units.
3.
decimal system - fractions are expressed in decimal notation.
not only makes this the notation unique, exhaustive and intuitively comparable, but also allows unit conversion without doing math - simply by shifts of the decimal point.
side note: modern mathematics, regardless of country, use the metric system.
hope this helps,     john

which is longer 4 miles or kilometers?
4 km is equal to 2.49 miles.
4 miles is equal to 6.437 km.
so 4 miles is a longer distance than 4 km.
you can use a formula to figure out the conversion from km to miles … .
the formula is: kilometers x 0.6214 = miles if you want to convert miles to km, the formula is: miles x 1.609 = kilometers algebraic steps / dimensional analysis formula 4 mi | * | 63360 in 1 mi | * | 2.54 cm 1 in | * | 1 km 100000 cm | = | 6.437376 km

what horse holds the track record in the preakness stakes?
secretariat officially holds the preakness stakes track record at  1:53 flat.
his time was corrected in 2012 by the maryland racing  commission, after having been in dispute … for 39 years.
prior to  that the debate was between secretariat and canonero ii due to a  clocking issue that occured during secretariat's 1973 run.
in  1973,secretariat was clocked by three racing officials at 1:53 and  two fifths.this would have beaten the record of 1:54:00 by three  fifths of a second.but the track's electric timer malfunctiond,and  the track's human timer timed him in 1:54and two fifths.even though  three had him in 1:53 and two fifths,the tracks time of 1:54 and  two fifths stood.cbs ran tape of the two races simultaneously,and  secretariat beat canonero by several lengths,proving the three  officials had it right all along.
who holds the preakness track record?
tank's prospect (1985) and louis quatorze (1996).

how many inches in a yard of fabric?
one yard equals 36 inches.
if you are trying to get square inches,  then multiply the length times width.
while a yard of fabric is always 36 inches long, the  width … can be 32", 34", 36", 45", 60."
draping and sheeting material  that can be bigger.

how many yards of fabric on a bolt?
the amount of yardage on the bolt varies.
from the manufacturer it is generally around 50 to 100 yards.
then the distributor will re-roll into 15 - 25 yards to sell to the ret … ailer.
sometimes the amount the retailer receives is actually less than he ordered, and there can be a conflict.
the amount is generally printed on the end of the bolt.

normally, temperature decreases as altitude increases.
in a temperature inversion, the temperature increases as altitude increases, up to the level of air that is causing the inversion.
see "temperature change as altitude increases?"
for info on how temperature normally decreases with altitude when there is not a temperature inversion.the rate at which the temperature goes down is down 1.1 degrees celsius for every 500 feet you go up.

what is the relationship between altitude temperature?
the air is thinner at high altitude.
meaning it is less dense than the air at sea level.
the more air there is the more heat it can trap.
but i have found that the relationshi … p only works in certain situations.
for instance in florida you will see that the climate is hot and muggy meaning that there is high humidity.
so for example florida is at sea level but they suffer from a wet excessive heat.
while in phoenix arizona they suffer from a dry excessive heat and are well above sea level by at least 1000 feet.
what really matters is time of year, which means relation from the sun, and distance from the earth's equator.
if you look at the globe you will notice the hotter regions lie close to the equator.

what is wrong with the statement the atoms of element x are isoelectronic with the atoms of element y?
nothing's wrong, except that it means elements x and y are in fact the same element, if their atoms have the same number of electrons.

do you need a passport to travel from the us to puerto rico?
there is always much confusion about travel between puerto rico  and the continental us.
if you are legally in the us then no  passport is needed to between puerto rico and … other parts o fthe  us.
as of june 1st, 2009 a passport is required for u.s. citizens  traveling to non-u.s. countries in the caribbean (so places other  than puerto rico and the u.s. virgin islands).
a birth certificate  is no longer sufficient.
all puerto ricans are us citizens and so can travel from puerto  rico to any other part of the us without a passport.
passports have become almost a necessity to travel anywhere  since 9-11.
however, puerto ricans are american citizens at birth  and have been since 1917.
in place of a passport, id that can be  used for dometic us air travel includes the state or commonwealth  issued driver's license or other state issued photo id.
keep in mind, it's good to have a passport because it will  benefit you when attempting to reenter the us from other countries.
they're inexpensive considering the benefits of identification and  registering valuables you already own to reduce the hassle of  duties on imports, etc. 

do you need a passport when traveling to puerto rico from any of the states?
passports have become almost a necessity to travel anywhere  since 9-11.
however, puerto ricans are us citizens at birth and  have been since 1917 and puerto rico is part of … the customs  territory of the us.
us citizens traveling from other points in the  us do not need a passport to enter puerto rico.
you will need a valid form of government-issued photo id to fly,  rent a car and possibly for other purposes and a passport can serve  that purpose, as can a state issued driver's license or id.
the puerto rican currency is the american dollar.
when  reentering the mainland, you do not have to declare purchases  relative to duties on imports as you would with other caribbean  islands.
keep in mind, it's good to have a passports because it will also  benefit you when attempting to reenter the us from other countries.

if you were born in puerto rico do you need passport to travel to puerto rico?
you will need a passport now because of a border security initiative set in place by the united states.
update: there are no passport or visas necessary for united states cit … izens (all persons born in puerto rico are us citizens), which means that us citizens can travel freely in and out of the island without going through immigration or customs.
us citizens only need to have some form of official government issued picture identification to enter puerto rico such as a current driver's license or a photo-identification card issued to non-drivers by a state's motor vehicles department.
for additional information, contact your local us embassy or call the puerto rico state department at (787) 722-2121.
note: citizens of other countries have the same requirements as for entering the usa.

according to the alphabetic principle , letters and combinations of letters are the symbols used to represent the speech sounds of a language based on systematic and predictable relationships between written letters, symbols, and spoken words.
the alphabetic principle is the foundation of any alphabetic writing system (such as the english variety of the roman alphabet ), which is one of the more common types of writing systems in use today.
alphabetic writing systems that use an (in practice) almost perfectly phonemic orthography have a single letter for each individual speech sound and a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and the letters that represent them.
such systems are used, for example, in the modern languages serbian (arguably, an example of perfect phonemic orthography), macedonian , estonian , finnish , italian , romanian , spanish , georgian , hungarian and turkish .
such languages have a straightforward spelling system, enabling a writer to predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation and similarly enabling a reader to predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling.
ancient languages with such almost perfectly phonemic writing systems include avestic , latin , tamil , vedic , and sanskrit ( devanāgarī — an abugida ; see vyakarana ).
on the other hand, french and english have a strong difference between sounds and symbols.
the alphabetic principle does not underlie logographic writing systems like chinese or syllabic writing systems such as japanese kana .
korean , along with chinese and japanese, is a member of the cjk group and shares origins for many of the symbols.
hangul , the korean writing system, is actually strongly alphabetic while it may look logographic or syllabic to outsiders.

latin alphabet [ edit ]
main article: latin alphabet
most orthographies that use the latin writing system are imperfectly phonological and diverge from that ideal to a greater or lesser extent.
this is because the ancient romans designed the alphabet specifically for latin.
in the middle ages, it was adapted to the romance languages, the direct descendants of latin, as well as to the celtic, germanic, baltic, and some slavic languages, and finally to most of the languages of europe.
english orthography [ edit ]
main article: english orthography
english orthography is based on the alphabetic principle, but the acquisition of sounds and spellings from a variety of languages has made english spelling patterns confusing.
spelling patterns usually follow certain conventions but nearly every sound can be legitimately spelled with different letters or letter combinations. [1]
for example, the letters ee almost always represent /i/ , but the sound can also be represented by the letter y .
the spelling systems for some languages, such as spanish , are relatively simple because they adhere closely to the ideal one-to-one correspondence between sounds and the letter patterns that represent them.
in english the spelling system is more complex and varies considerably in the degree to which it follows the stated pattern.
there are several reasons for this, including: first, the alphabet has 26 letters, but the english language has 40 sounds that must be reflected in word spellings; second, english spelling began to be standardized in the 15th century, and most spellings have not been revised to reflect the long-term changes in pronunciation that are typical for all languages; and third, english frequently adopts foreign words without changing the spelling of those words.
role in beginning reading [ edit ]
see also: phonics and whole language
learning the connection between written letters and spoken sounds has been viewed as a critical heuristic to word identification for decades.
understanding that there is a direct relationship between letters and sounds enables an emergent reader to decode the pronunciation of an unknown written word and associate it with a known spoken word.
typically, emergent readers identify the majority of unfamiliar printed words by sounding them out.
similarly, understanding the relationship of letters and sounds is also seen as a critical heuristic for learning to spell.
[2] [3] [4]
two contrasting philosophies exist with regard to emergent readers learning to associate letters to speech sounds in english.
proponents of phonics argue that this relationship needs to be taught explicitly and to be learned to automaticity , in order to facilitate the rapid word recognition upon which comprehension depends. [5]
others, including advocates of whole-language who hold that reading should be taught holistically , assert that children can naturally intuit the relationship between letters and sounds.

python: checking type of variable
ashwin uncategorized january 28, 2010 0 minutes
isinstance () seems to be the preferred way to check the type of a python variable.
it checks if the variable (object) is an instance of the class object being checked against.
# variables of different types i = 1 f = 0.1 s = "hell" l = [0, 1, 2] d = {0:"zero", 1:"one"} t = (0, 1, 2) b = true n = none
all of the following return true :
isinstance(i, int) isinstance(f, float) isinstance(s, str) isinstance(l, list) isinstance(d, dict) isinstance(t, tuple)
true and false are an instance of bool , so:
isinstance(b, bool)
what about none ?
for that, there is always:
n is none

poker beginners guide: low hand rankings (1)
low hands in poker can often be confusing for newcomers to the game.
indeed, even experienced players make mistakes reading the low board from time to time.
the two key things to remember are:
1.
your lowest five cards count, but these cards must all be different ranks .
(paired cards only qualify as one low card, not two!)
2.
the first card to consider is the highest card of your five, then the next highest card and so on.
in hi/lo poker an ace counts as a low card when you are calculating the low part of the board.
in fact, the ace is the best possible low card, then the deuce, then the trey.
thus the ace is doubly important in hi/lo games – it is the best card for the low side of the pot as well as for the high end.
flushes and straights are completely ignored for the purposes of the low pot.
the best possible low hand on omaha hi/lo (and stud hi/lo) is 5-4-3-2-a, which is often known as the wheel (or bicycle ).
you will notice that the 'wheel' is also a five-high straight on the high end of the board, which makes it a very powerful holding in hi/lo games.
in hi/lo games, there is always an eight qualifier for the low.
in other words, to qualify as a low hand, you must have five different cards ranked eight or below.
thus 8-7-6-5-4 qualifies as a low hand in hi/lo games, whereas 9-4-3-2-a and 4-3-3-2-a do not.
the 9-4-3-2-a hand contains only four qualifying low cards (the nine is disqualified), and the 4-3-3-2-a hand only has four cards of different ranks (pairs are also not permitted).

stop bias
syracuse university puts students' rights front and center.
we believe that every student should be given a college experience that is free of crime, discrimination, sexual harassment, and any other violation.
we strive to foster learning and growth in an environment that is safe and secure, and we lead the way with stop bias at syracuse.
stop bias is a collaborative campus effort that began in 2010 to raise awareness about bias and promote a culture of respect and inclusivity.
it provides the campus community with resources to help those who have been impacted by bias-related incidents on and around campus.
here you will be able to find information about bias and avenues for support and reporting, connect to opportunities for education and dialogue, and get involved with other community members to support the university’s efforts in creating a safer and more welcoming environment for everyone.

for a short time in a reasonable dose.
if you are generally healthy, you can take the recommended dosages of naproxen (aleve) and aspirin together for a few days.
if you are prone to stomach, bleeding, or kidney problems, don't do it.
but you probably know that already.
if you depend on low-dose aspirin for your heart health, ask your doctor.
naproxen can cancel out the benefits of the aspirin.
do not take ibuprofen (motrin/advil) with aspirin.
this is the nsaid that is implicated in most serious interactions with aspirin.
we, therefore, conclude that the metabolic interaction, although real, results in changes of such small magnitude as to be of no clinical significance.
together?
you should not take aspirin and naproxen sodium simultaneously.
you can google on naproxen sodium side effects and get tons of info.
i wouldn't.
if naproxen isn't solving the problem you might want to get some medical attention.
that's some pretty strong stuff and it should take care of most minor pain and inflamation.

can you take vicodin and naproxen together?
answer .
yes because vicodin has hydrocodone/tylenol....naproxen is an anti inflammatory medication.
they are from two separate families of medication and are safe to take … together.
the biggest problem with this is that the vicodin can be upsetting to the stomach as well as the naproxen.
stomach and gastrointestinal upset is a possible side effect.

can you take darvocet and naproxen together?
always check with your doctor first, i was prescribed naproxen 500mg and propoxyphene n 100/apap 650mg together.
according to this website http://www.drugdigest.org/dd/interac … tion/choosedrugs/1,4109,,00.html there are no interactions but each body chemistry is different.
also, as with anything with large amounts of acetaminophen try to schedule a annual appointment so that you can be sure your liver is not being damaged.

can you take skelaxin and naproxen together?
a guarded yes.
skelaxin (metaxalone) and naproxyn serve different functions.
metaxalone is a muscle relaxant and naproxyn is an anti-inflamatory.
what's more, their phar … mokinetics are significantly different, so interaction problems are not overtly likely.
i have not been able to find any direct synergy or contraindication between these two drugs.
i would assume that these two medications can be taken in conjunction, at the proper dosages, with no ill effects derrived from an interaction.
that said, these are both prescription medications and, while neither is especially dangerous if adminstered correctly under a doctor's care, this question should be properly addressed to a medical doctor.
note that i do not offer this as medical advice, nor do i represent myself to be a healthcare professional.
pm d
can you take naproxen and tylenol together?
naproxen is a nsaid (non steriodal anti inflammatory drug) and tylenol is an analgesic they both work in different way.
both medication can be taken together if both are req … uired.
tylenol 3 (with codeine) can also be taken with naproxen.
make sure you take naproxen with food.
it doesn't matter for tylenol.
both can be taken at the same moment, or in the same day.
it won't affect the clearance of those drugs.

can you take flexeril and naproxen together?
of course.
i am guessing you got these prescribed because a car accident?
someone rear ended me today with her going 60 and me parked, major whiplash, and the doc gave me both … of these.
but yeah, you definitely can take together.
***   the two are commonly prescribed together.
do be careful.
i was given them after a car accident and the combination of the two made me act really weird.
i felt really aggressive, lost track of time, was confused, upset, kind of delusional.
i'd have someone else around to watch you before you take the two of them together.
i could have really hurt myself if my husband hadn't been there.

can you take naproxen and metaxalone together?
yes, one is a non-narcotic pain reliever and the other is a muscle relaxer.
i am currently on zoloft for anxiety and i had an issue with my back.
the two drugs might cause pos … sible bleeding of the stomach if i'm not careful or drink alcohol with it, but alone they're safe and at the most might make you more relaxed and sleepy.
just don't drive commercially or operate heavy machinery.

define physical education?
the primary aims of physical education have varied, based on the needs of the time and place.
most modern schools' goal is to provide students with knowledge, skills, capaciti … es, values, and the enthusiasm to maintain a healthy lifestyle into adulthood.
activities included in the program are designed to promote physical fitness, to develop motor skills, to instill knowledge and understanding of rules, concepts, and strategies.
students learn to either work as part of a team, or as individuals, in a wide variety of competitive activities.
in all states in the united states, physical education is offered to students from grades k through 12.
most states do require physical education from 6th through 9th grades and offer "elective" physical education classes from 10th through 12th grades.
physical education trends have developed recently to incorporate more activities into p.e. introducing students to lifetime activities like bowling, walking/hiking, or frisbee at an early age can help students develop good activity habits that will carry over into adulthood.
teaching non-traditional sports to students may also provide the necessary motivation for students to increase their activity, and can help students learn about different cultures.
for example, while teaching a unit about lacrosse (in say arizona), students can also learn a little bit about the native american cultures of the northeast and eastern canada, where lacrosse originated.
teaching non-traditional (or non-native) sports provides a great opportunity to integrate academic concepts from other subjects as well (social studies from the example above), which is required of every p.e. teacher these days.
there are also many different models that have been created as of late that change the face of p.e.
one example of this is the health club model.
teaching with this model is very different from the "organized recess" of 20 or 30 years ago.
spun off the the boom in the health club industry, a p.e. class provides many of the same "classes" that are found at a health club.
monday a student could be doing kickboxing, the next day is yoga, wednesday the student is doing spinning.
this type of program provides a great variety of activity for students, a lot a high intensity exercise, and helps introduce these activities for use later in life.
the sports education model is another example of a new model were the class is run like a sports league, with students taking the role of coaches, scorers, referees, and reporters as well as players.
using this model, students practice management skills, mathematic skills, and writing skill all while learning sports skills and being active.
another trend is the incorporation of health and nutrition to the physical education curriculum.
the child nutrition and wic reauthorization act of 2004 required that all school districts with a federally funded school meal program develop wellness policies that address nutrition and physical activity.
while teaching students sports and movement skills, p.e. teachers are now incorporating short health and nutrition lessons into the curriculum.
this is more prevalent at the elementary school level, where students do not have a specific health class.

what is physical development?
physical development is development of the body..
as physical development proceeds, the child acquires various skills such as -.
motor skills - which require co-ordination … between brain and muscles.
these skills often require a great deal of practice and before becoming automatic.
gross motor skills - use the large muscles of the arms, legs, hips, and back such as when sitting, walking, catching, climbing, kicking a ball, throwing etcâ¦.
fine manipulative skills - involve the co-ordination of the smaller muscles of the hands and fingers for pointing, drawing, doing up buttons, using a knife and fork, writing etcâ¦

we made a small quantum computer (like really small and cant actually compute anything)    recent breakthroughs in fusion have lead to new fusion experiments being buil … t, namely iter and jet.
hopefully leading to usable fusion power within our life time.
metamaterials have been created to make invisibility cloaks outside of the optical wavelengths, with hope to create optical invisibility cloaks in the near future(ala harry potter)    we found that quatum effects can be brought to the macro level, showing the the line between quantum mechanics and newtonian is more of a grey area than a firm line.
we found that if you peel scotch tape in a vaccume you get x-rays (seriously)    and like a million others.

a particle is defined as a small object that behaves as a whole unit in terms of its transport and properties.
it is further classified according to size: in terms of diameter … , fine particles cover a range between 100 and 2500 nanometer, while ultrafine particles, on the other hand, are sized between 1 and 100 nanometers.
similar to ultrafine particles, nanoparticles are sized between 1 and 100 nanometers.

i know of only three types: central vacuole - helps maintain plants' shape and structure by storing water (hypotonic).
contractile vacuole - pumps water out of protist cells to maintain a suitable concentration.
food vacuole - storage for molecules that is a food source for the cell (phagocytosis).

what are the functions of the vacuole?
vacuoles are the "storage system" of the cell.
they storenutrients, waste, enzymes, and water.
they appear as a large,empty, colorless gap.
think of vacuoles as large warehous … es thatstore toxic wastes, or other useful, excessive products.
vacuolesare significantly larger in plant cells than animal cells.
thevacuole fills with water and other nutrients and pushes up againstthe cell wall making the wall stronger and stiffer.
this is onereason why if you forget to water your plant the vacuole is not asbig and the plant wilts.
a vacuole maintains the acidic internal phof the cell.
they also isolate the harmful substances produced by acell.
vacuoles also protect cells from certain bacteria and destroyany invading bacteria.
vacuoles are surrounded by membranes.
inanimal cells vacuoles may store food that needs to be digested.
food cannot pass through membranes until it is broken into smallerparticles.
the lysosome can fuse with the vacuole membrane andsquirt digestive enzymes into the food vacuole to break down whatis in there.
your white blood cells do this when they eat invadingbacteria.
vacuoles can also store the undigestible wastes untilthey can fuse with the cell membrane and squirt the wastes outside.
vacuoles in animal cells can form when the cell membrane surroundsa material and pinches off to bring the substance inside the cell.this process is called endocytosis.
there are no options provided regarding the vacuole.
however, the vacuole has many functions in the cell which include maintaining the turgor pressure, keeping harmful substances away from the cell and also maintain an acid internal ph in the cell among other functions.
what are the three types of rna and their functions?
the three types of rna is mrna, trna and rrna. rrna is ribosomal  rna makes an important part of the ribosome. trna is for transfer  rna that transfers amino acids to riboso … me like messenger rna says.
mrna is for messenger rna who carries messages to other parts of  the cell.
how does a vacuole function?
it store wastes nutrients and reserved cell material

also serve to  relay signals from place to place within the central nervous  system.

what are three types of rna and their functions?
messenger rna (mrna) consists of rna nucleotides in the form of single uncoiled chain. mrna carries genetic information from the dna in the nucleus to the cytosol of a eukayot … ic cell.
transfer rna (trna) consists of single chain of about 80 rna nucleotide folded into a hairpin shape that bind to specific amino acids.there are about 45 varieties of trna ribosomal rna (rrna) is the most abundant form of rna. rrna consists of rna nucleotides in a globular form. joined by proteins, rrna makes up ribosomes where proteins are made.

what is the function of the vacuol?
vacuoles do not perform any single function .
they perform many.
now read below.
vacuoles are membrane-bounded compartments within some eukaryotic cells that can serve a v … ariety of secretory, excretory, and storage functions.
vacuoles and their contents are considered to be distinct from the cytoplasm, and are classified as ergastic according to some authors.
vacuoles are especially conspicuous in most plant cells.
in general, vacuole functions include: 1) removing unwanted structural debris 2) isolating materials that might be harmful to the cell 3) containment of waste products 4) maintaining internal hydrostatic pressure or turgor within the cell 5) maintaining an acidic internal ph 6) containing small molecules 7)exporting unwanted substances from the cell.
8)enabling the cell to change shape.
vacuoles also play a major role in autophagy, maintaining a balance between biogenesis (production) and degradation (or turnover), of many substances and cell structures.
they also aid in destruction of invading bacteria or of misfolded proteins that have begun to build up within the cell.

why is rusting a chemical change?
chemical change can be defined in its simplest manner as a reactionã¢â‚¬ that happens when two or more molecules interact with each other and produce a new form of substance.
in the case of rusting, a chemical change takes place when iron (fe) on metal comes together with oxygen (o2), which is in the atmosphere, and then creates rust (fe2o3) or the red substance commonly seen on steel and metal objects that are products of either oxidation or weathering.
rusts are a product of chemical change in a way that iron substances on metals, before they interact with another matter, are completely altered in the process thus producing a new substance that is rust.
the changes that happen are permanent in nature and irreversible.
rusts are also known as iron oxide which is a common compound.
it is said to be commonã¢â‚¬ because iron merges easily with oxygen, which is why it is hard to find a pure iron in its natural form.
rusting on iron is an example of corrosionã¢â‚¬ or the deterioration of metals because of a chemical reaction.
there are three things that are included that produces iron oxide and these are iron, oxygen, and water.
below is the brief explanation on the process of rusting.
when water gets in touch with an iron substance (like steel or metal) an immediate reaction occur that initiates chemical change.
the water that acts as a good electrolyte then merges with carbon dioxide in the air.
the process then creates a weak carbonic acid which is also an enhanced electrolyte.
while the acid is forming, the iron is diffused and few quantities of water will also start to break down to its primary molecular components, oxygen and hydrogen.
the released oxygen plus the diffused iron joins together and then results to iron oxide.

story
spoiler warning: this article or section may contain major plot or ending details!
proceed with caution.
buzz buzz appears moments after a bright light engulfs the meteor
the story begins when ness is awakened by a meteor that has plummeted to the earth near his home, whereupon he proceeds to investigate the crash site.
when ness gets to the crash site he discovers a police road block and pokey minch, his friend and neighbor, who tells him to go home.
later, ness is woken up again by pokey knocking at his door, demanding help to find his brother picky.
they find him near the meteor sleeping behind a tree and wake him up.
then the three encounter an insect from the meteor named buzz buzz who informs ness that he is from the future where the "universal cosmic destroyer", giygas , dominates the planet.
buzz buzz senses great potential in ness and instructs him to embark on a journey to seek out and record the melodies of eight " sanctuaries ," unite his own powers with the earth's and gain the strength required to confront giygas.
after an encounter with some hostile gang members, ness reaches the first sanctuary on a mountain above his hometown.
he then proceeds to the next town, twoson, where he rescues a girl named paula from the happy happyist cult and discovers that pokey (who has been the high priest of cult) is working against him.
together, ness and paula discover the second sanctuary.
with the help of the runaway five , a band that ness and paula free from debt, the two arrive in threed , where they are ambushed and captured.
while in captivity, paula sends a telepathic message to a boy named jeff, who resides at a boarding school.
jeff responds to the message and acquires his father's sky runner , a flying vehicle, in order to reach threed.
after crashing the sky runner, jeff rescues ness and paula and joins their group.
the three of them travel to saturn valley , a land populated by a strange race of creatures called mr. saturns .
there, the party learns that a monster has been kidnapping the populace .
ness and the group proceed to defeat the monster and reach the third sanctuary above saturn valley.
the party then travels through the desert to reach the next city.
screenshot depicting ness, paula, jeff and poo as they travel through summers
upon reaching fourside , the group again helps the runaway five out of debt and visits a department store only to have paula kidnapped.
ness and jeff proceed to find her, and along the way, destroy a hallucination-projecting relic called the mani-mani statue .
the two boys continue their search only to discover that pokey and the mayor have taken paula.
however, because ness and jeff defeated the evil mani-mani, the mayor returns to normal.
pokey escapes in the mayor's helicopter and paula rejoins the group.
after returning to threed, jeff repairs the sky runner, and they set flight for winters to discover the fourth sanctuary.
the group then cross the ocean and arrive in summers where ness falls unconscious and dreams of a far-off land known as dalaam.
there, a young prince named poo has completed his training and is instructed to join the party on their journey.
the group then returns to fourside and are able to discover the fifth sanctuary.
the four then procure a boat and travel to scaraba where they explore a pyramid in the desert.
ness and the group then travel to dalaam and find the sixth sanctuary there, after which they acquire a submarine and travel into the deep darkness , a path leading them under the earth.
there, they find tenda village , a small community populated by extremely shy creatures .
after acquiring the book of overcoming shyness , ness is able to speak to the shy villagers who allow them passage to the lost underworld .
there, they discover the last two sanctuaries.
upon activating the final sanctuary, ness falls unconscious and enters a strange world composed of his dreams, magicant .
there, he encounters his nightmare .
after defeating it, magicant vanishes, and ness becomes much stronger because he has conquered giygas's influence over him.
after awakening, ness and the group return to saturn valley where jeff's father, dr. andonuts , has finished the phase distorter, a time traveling device.
dr.
andonuts explains the kids that the machine cannot warp them to the past in their current form since life cannot withstand the warp through time.
in other words, time travel would likely destroy their human bodies.
to remedy this problem, dr. andonuts proposes to them to have their souls transplanted into robotic bodies, warning them that he doesn't know whether or not the process is reversible.
despite this critical warning, ness, paula, jeff and poo are willing to take the risk.
now in the form of robots, ness and his friends use the phase distorter to travel to the past where they encounter pokey and giygas, who, in order to contain his massive power, has been sealed inside the devil's machine.
pokey informs the group that giygas became so powerful that his mind was completely destroyed, referring to him as an "all-mighty idiot".
the group defeat pokey, who then shuts off the devil's machine and releases giygas, trapping the kids in a chaotic dimension composed of his own indefinable being.
since giygas is too powerful for ness and his friends to overcome by fighting, paula begins to pray, reaching out to the inhabitants of the earth, including family members and friends, who all pray for their safety, and eventually, she reaches out to the player.
the combined prayers of both earth's inhabitants and the player reach giygas and exploit his weakness, which turns out to be human emotions.
as a result, giygas vanishes from existence. with all the damage he had done to eagleland and the rest of the earth erased from history, the souls of ness and his friends depart from their robot bodies, travel back to the present and return to their respective bodies.
after bidding each other farewell, the heroes return to their homes.
after the ending credits, picky minch comes to ness's house in the middle of the night and gives him a letter from pokey that says " come and get me loser.
spankety, spankety, spankety! ", and the game ends with him and ness pondering what has become of him.
characters

athens state university (asu), located in athens , limestone county , is the oldest continuously operating public institution of higher education in the state of alabama .
it is unique in that it offers the final two years of a college curriculum, which complement the first two years' curriculum offered by the rest of the state's community college system.
the university plays host to the tennessee valley old time fiddlers convention every october.
asu began as a private academy in 1821, when alabama supreme court judge john mckinley donated land to the athens state university city of athens to establish the athens female academy.
the initial institution, which began classes in january 1822, consisted of a four-room school house, with 24-year-old baptist minister daniel perrin bestor as head.
its progressive goal was to provide elementary, secondary, and college-level instruction to girls and young women.
in the early nineteenth century, college-level instruction was known as academy education, although some students graduated at a significantly younger age than do present-day college students.
students were primarily the daughters of local well-to-do families who were able to afford the school's tuition.
during the summer of 1842, the trustees of the athens female academy and a group of the city's residents decided to work toward affiliating the school with the methodist church , which was developing its own system of higher education.
the goal was to attract boarding students from a much wider geographical area and increase enrollment and expand the curriculum.
founders hall in october 1842, the tennessee conference of the methodist episcopal church held its annual meeting in athens, and local representatives successfully petitioned the organization to sponsor the academy.
at the same time, various local families donated the money to build founders hall, the oldest building on the current campus.
the institution was renamed athens female institute of the tennessee annual conference, with methodist minister richard henderson rivers serving as its first president.
the alabama legislature formally recognized that name change in january 1843.
the new institute offered elementary, preparatory, and collegiate curricula in the liberal arts, a focus that has characterized the college through most of its history.
enrollment rose from 80 students in 1843 to almost 200 but leveled off in the 1850s.
in 1858, jane hamilton childs, head of the huntsville female college, was appointed president.
she renamed the school the athens collegiate institute and kept it functioning during the turbulent civil war years, even as the town was besieged by union troops.
when childs retired in 1869, the school largely reverted to educating the daughters of area families who could afford the tuition.
in 1870, the north alabama conference of the methodist church south was established and took control of the school, renaming it the north alabama female college.
in 1872, the alabama legislature formally recognized the school's name as the athens female institute.
in 1889, the legislature once again changed the name to athens female college.
efforts to establish a significant endowment for the college continued from 1869 to 1904 without success.
low enrollment and financial troubles plagued the school during the latter part of the nineteenth century.
mccandless hall in 1904, mary norman moore became the president of the college.
during her tenure, the school abandoned elementary education to focus on developing a modern higher education curriculum.
in 1915, the school was renamed the athens college for young women and was usually referred to as athens college.
moore stepped down in 1916 upon her marriage (and became known as mary moore-mccoy) but returned after being widowed to serve a second term as president from 1925 to 1930, making her the only person to serve as president of athens twice.
in 1910, the college gained class b status from the methodist conference, which was based on having at least seven full-time faculty and annual endowment income of $5,000 or more.
accreditation by the southern association of colleges and schools followed in 1911, and in 1913 the methodist conference raised the college to class a status, after it achieved the minimum endowment of $100,000.
moore also hired concert pianist kate mccandless in 1911 to develop the music program, which for many years after was a centerpiece of the curriculum.
eugene r. naylor, the first male president who was an academic rather than a clergyman, took the helm during the summer of 1930.
that same year, naylor decided to offset the chronic under-enrollment and the effects of the great depression by admitting male students, despite the school's renown as an elite women's institution.
in recognition of this change, in 1939 the alabama legislature officially shortened the name of the school to athens college.
building on the foundations established by moore, under naylor's leadership athens college increased its reputation for the quality of its academic programs.
after naylor resigned as president in 1949, succeeding presidents strove to expand and develop the curriculum athens state university library and programs with varying levels of success.
in 1970, sidney e. sandridge became president of athens college at a time when the deteriorating finances of the college were reaching a crisis.
the state of alabama assumed ownership of athens college in 1975.
after a series of intense debates and negotiations in the state legislature, the college's name was changed to athens state college and the curriculum was refocused to serve as the two-year upper-division college within alabama's community college system.
all students attending athens state are transfers from either community colleges or four-year institutions.
no general education courses are offered.
in 1981, sandridge was succeeded by calhoun community college president james chasteen and then by jerry f. bartlett in 1990.
during his term as president, bartlett oversaw the expansion of distance learning technology, which allowed athens state to expand its outreach to traditionally underserved students.
in 1998, the college was renamed athens state university.
in 2009, robert k. glenn became president, following in the footsteps of his great grandfather edgar m. glenn, who served as president from 1902-1904.
athens state offers more than 30 undergraduate majors through three colleges: business, arts and sciences, and education.
in the fall semester of 2010, tvotfc audience at founder's hall athens state university enrolled more than 3,700 students.
it employs a full time faculty and staff of approximately 250 people and has an annual budget of approximately $58 million.
intercollegiate sports were ended during the 2003-04 academic year, although the university's mascot remains hebrew the bear.
students have the opportunity to participate in more than 35 clubs and organizations on campus such as the student government association, the health and science career club, and the mathematics and computer science club.
major college honor societies such as sigma tau delta, psi chi, phi alpha theta, and kappa delta pi have chapters on campus also.

how do you file a personal injury claim?
first you should get a lawyer one who does not receive any money until the claim is settled.
his payment should be agreed on before he is hired.
the lawyer should only receive … e money if your case is settled in your favor.
after hiring a lawyer have them check to see if you have pip insurance.
pip insurance is personal insurance protection.
if you have this fill out the paper work asap.
the other good thing about having this is that it will not affect your insurance rates.

when to file a bodily injury claim?
you should do it as soon as possible so you can receive help from processionals and reduce your losses.
you can use a claims management company or go directly to a solicitor. …
we recommend to use a firm like a claims management company as they will look after you on a daily basis, plus the solicitors of course too.
so you receive an extra service free of charge.
the other advantage of using the claims management company is that they know who is a good solicitor !
if they are unhappy about the service you receiving they will move you to other panel of solicitors.
if you had an accident probably you will be using such service first time... a claims management company do this on a daily basis and knows who is good.
if on the end you still want to go direct to a solicitor make sure your claim handler is someone who had an experience in such cases.
trainees solicitors do sometime mistakes and if they are not spot by a claims management company or you it may cost you time, money and health.

where is it possible to file claims for an accident or an injury?
to file a claim for compensation for an injury due to negligence, there are injury and accidents forms that a claimant needs to fill out.
these forms will ask the claimant to … give details about the injury or accident.
if a claimant does not feel comfortable doing this on their own, they should hire an attorney who specializes in accident and injury claims.

does caffeine effect taking hydrocodone
does acetaminophen hydrocodone have caffeine in it
no, there is no caffeine in hydrocodone or in apap.
if you're experiencing insomnia, that's a side effect of the hydrocodone.

hydrocodone is hydrocodone.
however, all hydrocodone containing products in the us do have acetominophen (or some other secondary ingredient, such as homatropine in hycodan) … in them as well.

what is hydrocodone acetaminophen?
hydrocodone is a narcotic pain reliever, and cough suppressant.
how is works?
the brain works on many different electric signals, that react with the rest of our body, and he … lp decide what chemicals our body needs to function.
hydrocodone works by blocking the receptors on the nerve cells so we don't feel pain.
acetaminophen is a non-narcotic pain reliever and fever reducer it helps by elevating the nerves thus temporarily blocking or numbing the feeling of pain.
this is a prescription drug, used for moderate to severe pain relief.
and is also known as; vicodinanexsialorcet and is reactive with alcohol.
do they have hydrocodone without acetaminophen?
yes they do they make it with ibuprofen

what is hydrocodon acetaminophen?
hydrocodone / acetaminophen is a narcotic pain reliever a.k.a vicodin.
the drug comes as a tablet in varying amounts with the acetaminophen content being quite high.
this dr … ug is available through prescription only.
you should not take any other acetaminophen containing drugs (tylenol) while taking vicodin (unless directed by your doctor) because this can cause liver damage/failure.
a fair amount of drugs can interact with vicodin so you should consult your doctor on what is safe to take and what is not beforehand.
you also should not drink alcohol.
hope this was helpful

what happens if you snort hydrocodon-acetaminophen?
snorting a substance will irritate the nasal canals and cause pain and maybe bleeding.
snorting hydrocodone and/or acetaminophen would cause a faster reaction than swallowing … a pill, but you shouldn't snort any kind of drug without a doctor's orders.

sometimes you will take the absolute value of the percent error because your estimated number could be less than the theoretical, meaning the calculation is negative.
but an absolute value is always positive.
a percent error can be left as a negative though, and this would be perfectly acceptable (or even preferred) depending on what you're doing.
answer:in the sciences, a negative percent error indicates a low result.
if you have a 0% error, then your observed (lab) result was exactly the same as the theoretical result.
a 5% error could mean that your observed result was a little high.
a negative percent error is possible; if your observed results were lower than the expected, then you would have a negative percent error.
a -5% error could mean that your results were a little low.
having a negative percent error isn't worse than positive percent error -- it could mean the same thing.
if you were to have a choice in having a 20% error and a -5% error, the negative percent error is more accurate.

is there a difference percent error and percentage error?
the difference: -age (hey, it's not wrong...)
in general, probably not - percent and percentage are often used interchangeably.
the context of use may warrant a differ … ence though, if strict semantics are being followed: "percent error" would refer to the the maximum potential difference between what a value could be, and what that value is stated to be.
"percentage error", in such a scenario, would refer to an erroneous percentage (as in, the percentage itself is incorrect).

what does negative percentage error indicate?
in a numerical analysis sense, it means you've made a mistake/forgotten to take the modulus, as the formula for error calculation involves taking modulus values:     …
erel= |x-x*| / |x|, where x is the proper value, and x* an approximate value.
percentage error is just the relative error (formula above) x100, so really if you calculate it correctly, its actually impossible to get a negative percentage error.
that aside, the only thing a negative error means, besides making a mistake, is that your approximation is larger/smaller than the real value, depending on which one you take away from, as it doesn't matter if you do x-x* or x*-x due to the modulus.
the only thing that matters about any error value, is the size/number, which indicates by how much your approximation differs from the real value.

how are the error and the percent error of a measurement calculated?
take the correct value, subtract the value you got, and then divide that figure by the correct value.
then take the absolute value of that and multiply by 100.
for example, sa … y i weighed something and got that it was 2.5 grams, but it really was 2.7 grams. 2.7-2.5=.2. .2/2.7=.074. .074*100=7.4.
thus, i had 7.4% error.
another example: 16-15=-1. -1/15=-.067. .067*100=6.7% error.
what does negative zero error mean?
there can't be a negative zero. zero is neither negative nor positive.

what does it mean if you get a negative number when you calculate for percent error?
depending on whether you subtract actual value from expected value or other way around, a positive or negative percent error, will tell you on which side of the expected val … ue that your actual value is.
for example, suppose your expected value is 24, and your actual value is 24.3 then if you do the following calculation to figure percent error: [percent error] = (actual value - expected value)/(actual value) - 1 --> then convert to percent.
so you have (24.3 - 24)/24 -1 = .0125 --> 1.25%, which tells me the actual is higher than the expected.
if instead, you subtracted the actual from the expected, then you would get a negative 1.25%, but your actual is still greater than the expected.
my preference is to subtract the expected from the actual.
that way a positive error tells you the actual is greater than expected, and a negative percent error tells you that the actual is less than the expected.

what is a periodical?
whenever you read an issue of time , sports illustrated or the fairbanks daily news miner , you are using a periodical.
periodicals are magazines, scholarly journals, newspapers, and newsletters.
they are publications that are published at regular intervals.
daily newspapers, weekly magazines, and quarterly journals are all periodicals.
many periodicals are written for a general audience whose readers are not expected to have specialized knowledge or training.
we usually call these periodicals magazines.
however, probably even more periodicals are written for specialists and have articles that are difficult for readers who lack that background.
these periodicals, written for a scholarly audience, are called journals.
for a better understanding of how to identify different types of periodicals, see scholarly vs. popular periodicals at the end of this lesson.
why use periodicals?
periodical articles are often the best sources to use in research report writing.
advantages
timeliness : the chief advantage that magazines have over books is time.
information comes out more quickly in periodicals than it can in books.
often times, an article that will eventually appear in book form, originally appears in an article in a magazine or journal.
some disciplines, especially the science and technology fields such as engineering, rely very heavily on periodicals for the latest developments in their rapidly changing fields.
original sources : results of original research are often printed in periodicals first.
reviews of new books, works of art and performances often only appear in periodicals.
often the information contained in a periodical article will never appear elsewhere, either in a book or other work.
ease of use : periodicals can often provide good summary information on a field.
for a short research paper, information from articles may be easier to manage than a lengthy book.
consider how in-depth you want your information to be.
disadvantages
outdated information : research results published in periodicals is often quickly disproved by more current research.
depending on what your topic is, you may want to make sure that the information you have is indeed the latest report.
a book may be a better format in that several studies may be compared at once and indicate the progression of different experiments or studies and may indicate a more complete picture.
incorrect information : because of the pressure of deadlines with periodicals, information is not always checked as thoroughly as it is in books.
this problem will vary, depending on the review policy of a particular publication.
lack of context : even if you are only interested in one section of a larger work on a topic, having the context of the larger work can help in the understanding of the one section.
where are periodicals located?
most of rasmuson library periodicals are available electronically,  accessible through rasmuson library databases .
some periodicals are still available in print and located in the periodicals collection on level 3 rasmuson library.
keep in mind, print periodicals can also be found on every other level of the library.
for example:
annual reports and proceedings from conferences can be found in the regular stacks
alaskan magazines and newspapers can be found in the alaska and polar regions collection
and journals from u.s. government agencies can be found in the government documents collection
the library catalog will indicate which collection and which level to find a specific periodical.
continue on to periodical indexes to learn how to find the articles on your topic and the periodicals that publish those articles.

how to join crochet squares – completely flat “zipper” method
there are so many methods for joining crochet squares.
this one is my favourite, though, both for how it looks and for how flat the resulting seams are.
let me tell you a little secret.
i had used this method years ago when i just started crocheting again and had not liked the fact that it took a bit longer than some of the other methods (i know!
lazy!!).
i was therefore very reluctant to give it another go.
beth, one of my testers and a very good friend, urged me to try it again.
she was adamant that i would love it.
and she was right!
it’s amazing :)
the zipper method does take a bit longer than the other methods out there, but give it a try and see how you like the finished result!
i am calling it the “zipper” method, because that is what beth called it.
and she is right again.
you crochet the blocks together as if you are zipping them up.
i have made the join with a contrasting colour to better illustrate how it works, but you can use the same colour as your squares and the seams will blend in effortlessly.
in the pictures above you can see that the slip stitches form a flat cable on the front of the blanket and a running stitch on the back.
how to join crochet squares using the “zipper” method
please note: to join the squares using the zipper method, you will place the squares side by side, instead of on top of each other.
when you place the squares side by side like this, the v’s formed by the stitches of the last row/round of each square will be parallel to each other.
the 2 front loops will be farthest away from each other (so on the outside of the join).
the 2 back loops will be right next to each other, so on the inside of the join.
for the purposes of this tutorial i will call them the inside loops ( see adjacent photo ).
you will be working only into the inside loops (back loops).
joining the squares
first you will need some squares.
i am using my iced pie squares for this tutorial.
next you will need to place your squares side by side with the right side of both facing up ( photo 2 ).
starting with the block to your left , insert your hook from front to back into the inside loop of the first stitch.
now insert your hook from front to back into the inside loop of the first stitch of the other square ( photo 3 ).
if you are going to be adding new yarn to join your crochet squares, add it now by placing a slip knot on your hook as in photo 4.
i like starting with a slip knot.
if you don’t like starting with a slip knot, simply yarn over with your new colour.
pull through both of the stitches (loops) on your hook ( photo 5 ).
insert your hook from front to back into the inside loop of the next stitch of the square on your left ( see photo 6) .
then insert your hook from front to back into the inside loop of the next stitch of the other square ( photo 7 ).
grab your yarn, which will be at the back of your work, and pull through all three loops on your hook ( photo 8 ).
remember to keep your tension loose.
slip stitches are not as elastic as other stitches, so if you work very tightly, your edges won’t have any “give”.
keep working a slip stitch into the inside loops of each stitch (through both layers) this until you have joined all the stitches down the side of your squares.
when you get to the end, bind off.
photo 9 below shows a different view of what it should look like when you have inserted your hook through both of the inside loops from front to back.
inserting your hook in this way will cause the two inside loops to lie on top of each other instead of side by side.
this is what makes the seam so flat.
photo 10 illustrates the seam from the front.
photo 11 illustrates the seam from the back.
you can join these squares in a grid like lucy from attic24 does in her tutorial , but because you are working with the squares side by side and the yarn in the back, it becomes a bit fiddly.
if you want to try this method, don’t bind off when you have finished joining the first two squares.
lay the next two squares next to each other as before and continue slip stitching them together as instructed above.
you can attach any number of squares in this fashion.
the idea is that you join all the squares in one direction first and then join all the squares in the other direction.
to join the “unjoined” sides, turn the joined squares 90 degrees and repeat the whole process.
the easier method by far is to join the crochet squares to each other in long strips, as if you were making a bunch of scarves.
you can then join these strips to each other using the method above.
when i make my squares i leave a 1 meter/1 yard tail of yarn when i bind off.
i use this tail to attach the crochet squares to each other as i make them.
if i left all the joining until the end, i would probably never complete a blanket.
if you find this “zipper” method too fiddly, have a look at this post from knot your nanas crochet .
it is a round-up of 10 tutorials for joining granny squares.
of the ten, lucy’s method (link above) is my favourite.
it is both easy and very well explained.
i hope you have found this tutorial useful.

block a week cal 2014
i’m guessing that you stumbled upon this post because you like making squares.
if i’m right, you might enjoy joining in the block a week cal (crochet-along) being hosted by kimberly slifer from the official ccc social group on facebook.
we are making 45 weekly squares over the course of the year.
at the end of the year we will be blocking and joining them so that we end up with a lovely blanket in time for christmas.
i will be doing a photo tutorial (with permission from the designers) for each block (apart from the first 4), so even if you are a beginner, you should be able to follow along.
interested?

my first granny square project!
i have made granny squares with a skirt in mind.
i am at the point of putting them together.
i keep going back to the drawing board though.
what method would you recommend that wouldn’t be too stiff, allowing for softness and closer to flat then raised?
thanks, gloria﻿

is it best to block the squares before joining?
i’m making a blanket with 4 large panels and i used tunisian crochet, which made the ends curl quite a bit.

i always block before joining so that i am sure the joins won’t be too tight.
but you don’t have to.
if you don’t like to block first, just make sure your joins are ok by checking for stretch periodically.

i’ve never seen this “zipper method” before.
it’s brilliant and has a really clean crisp look.
thank you for sharing.
now i’m going to check out what other great ideas you have!

you’re welcome.
it takes a bit of time, but i think it is well worth it if that is the look you desire.
if i want a much quicker method, i use the (sc, ch 1, skip 1) method.

how do you treat the corners when they are a chain 2?
do you skip them or put a stictch in them?
reply
dedri uys says
june 2, 2017 at 10:15 am
one of the chains belongs to one side of the square and the other one belongs to the other side.
when joining, you will make a sl st in the first chain of the ch-2 corner.
when joining the next 2 squares, you will make a sl st in the second chain of ch-2 corner from the next square.
when you go to join in the perpendicular direction, you will sl st in the remaining ch’s of each corner.
i hope that makes sense.

how did stalin transform the soviet union into a totalitarian state?
before lenin's death, stalin began establishing centralized powerby appointing his friends and allies into positions of power.
whenhe was the leader of the soviet union, he we … nt on to usestrategically propaganda and the secret police to establish atotalitarian state that quickly did away with opposition.
how did joseph stalin create a totalitarian state in the soviet union?
stalin was a master of using fear, eliminating his competition,  scapegoating, controlling education, creating an effective  propaganda machine, controlling the flow of info … rmation to the  people, and killing any communist party members who opposed his  regime.
he believed that he was the the true communist leader and  to carry out all of his policies, he had to be the ussr's dictator.
no threat to his power was too small to liquidate.
within a few  years after lenin's death, stalin created his totalitarian state.

ture or false in the soviet union communism was already established when joseph stalin cae to power in the mid - 1920s?
false.
most people would say true, because vladimir lenin had orchestrated the bolshevik revolution in october 1917 (november new style) and then won the russian civil war bef … ore stalin came to power.
the fact is that "communism" as karl marx predicted it has never been established in any country.
lenin established socialism after the revolution and stalin continued socialism after lenin was dead.
and it was a miserable excuse of socialism at that.
lenin's brand of socialism wasn't true marxian socialism either.
stalin only made it worse.
but something had already been established before stalin came to power.
it just wasn't communism.
how did joseph stalin rule the soviet union?
he was a bad leader according to peasants.
he was also a bad leader  among marxist leninists.
stalin took care of the marxists and  anyone who threatened his power by execut … ing them.
by the end of  the 1930's he killed over 30,000 marxists and/or people he feared  within the soviet union.
they feared of him taking over europe.
joseph stalin was the one (along with government) that decided to  put up the iron curtain.
the iron curtain was a border line  separating east and west germany.
peasants were not aloud to cross  it because government didn't want eastern germany to see the many  rights that other countries had.

lesson 24: surface area
student outcomes
 students determine the surface area of three-dimensional figures—those that are composite figures and those
that have missing sections.
lesson notes
this lesson is a continuation of lesson 23.
students continue to work on surface area advancing to figures with missing
sections.
classwork
example 1 (8 minutes)
students should solve this problem on their own.
example 1
determine the surface area of the image.
surface area of top or bottom prism:
lateral sides =�:�� 𝐢�.×� 𝐢�.;=��� 𝐢� �
base face =�� 𝐢�.×�� 𝐢�. =��� 𝐢� �
base face with hole =�� 𝐢�.×�� 𝐢�.− � 𝐢�.×� 𝐢�.
=��� 𝐢� �
there are two of these, making up ��� 𝐢� � .
surface area of middle prism:
lateral sides: =�: 𝐢�.×� ;��� �
surface area: ��� 𝐢� � +��� 𝐢� � =��� 𝐢� �
 describe the method you used to determine the surface area.
 answers will vary.
i determined the surface area of each prism separately and added them together.
then, i subtracted the area of the sections that were covered by another prism.
 if all three prisms were separate, would the sum of their surface areas be the same as the surface area you
determined in this example?
 no, if the prisms were separate, there would be more surfaces shown.
the three separate prisms would
have a greater surface area than this example.
the area would be greater by the area of four
4 in.×4 in. squares ( 64 in 2 ).
scaffolding:
as in lesson 23, students can
draw nets of the figures to help
them visualize the area of the
faces.
they could determine
the area of these without the
holes first and subtract the
surface area of the holes.

 we also have to add the area of each of the interior faces to the total surface area.
 what happens to the surfaces that now show inside the cube?
 these are now part of the surface area.
 what is the shape of the piece that was removed from the cube?
 a rectangular prism was cut out of the cube with the following dimensions: 4 in.×4 in.×12 in.
 how can we use this to help us determine the new total surface area?
 we can find the surface area of the cube and the surface area of the rectangular prism, but we will
have to subtract the area of the square bases from the cube and also exclude these bases in the area of
the rectangular prism.
 why is the surface area larger when holes have been cut into the cube?
 there are more surfaces showing now.
all of the surfaces need to be included in the surface area.

 :explain how the expression 612 in.; 2 −2:4 in.×4 in.;+4:12 in.×4 in.;represents the surface area of the
cube with the hole.
 from the total surface area of a whole (uncut) cube, 6:12 in.; 2 , the area of the bases (the cuts made to
the surface of the cube) are subtracted: 6:12 in.; 2 −2:4 in.×4 in.; .
to this expression we add the
area of the four lateral faces of the cutout prism, 4:12 in.×4 in.; .

find the height of the four lateral triangular faces.
area of base =�� 𝐢�.×�� 𝐢�. =��� 𝐢� �
area of the four faces =��� 𝐢� � −��� 𝐢� � =��� 𝐢� �

the height of each lateral triangular face is � inches.
 what strategies could you use to help you solve this problem?
 i could draw a picture of the pyramid and label the sides so that i can visualize what the problem is
asking me to do.
 what information have we been given?
how can we use the information?
 we know the total surface area, and we know the length of the sides of the square.
 we can use the length of the sides of the square to give us the area of the square base.
 how does the area of the base help us determine the height of the lateral triangular face?
 first, we can subtract the area of the base from the total surface area in order to determine what is left
for the lateral sides.
 next, we can divide the remaining area by 4 to get the area of just one triangular face.
 finally, we can work backward.
we have the area of the triangle, and we know the base is 10 in. , so
we can solve for the height.

her first solo swing was surprisingly successful.
i guess we have to trust him, but i wish he'd stop going solo and confide in us.
haydn's numerous examples of independent violoncello melodies are almost all either marked solo or written for such small orchestras that they would be played as solos .
thus there was quite as much important solo music for the flute as for the violin; and almost more music for the viola da gamba than for the violoncello.
in 1740, on the recommendation of the dean of hainburg, haydn obtained a place in the cathedral choir of st stephen's, vienna, where he took the solo-part in the services and received, at the choir school, some further instruction on the violin and the harpsichord.

a typical short-haired american (or self) guinea pig
guinea pigs (also called cavies after their scientific name) are rodents belonging to the family caviidae and the genus cavia.
despite their common name, the animals are not pigs, nor do they come from guinea.
male guinea pigs are called boars , females are called
sows , and babies are called pups .
they are originally native to the andes, and while they are no longer extant in the wild, they are closely related to several species which are commonly found in the grassy plains and plateaus of this region.
the guinea pig plays an important role in the folk culture of indigenous south americans, especially as a food source, but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies.
since the 1960s, the guinea pig has become increasingly important as a staple food in the andes, and efforts have been made to increase consumption of the animal outside south america.
see the cookbook entry for links to recipes.
in western societies, the guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet since its introduction by european traders in the sixteenth century.
because of its docile nature, the relative ease of caretaking, and its responsiveness to handling and feeding, the guinea pig remains a popular pet choice.
organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and a large number of specialized breeds of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders.

choosing a guinea pig [ edit ]
a long-haired cavy such as this peruvian may be cute, but it takes extensive daily grooming to keep them healthy and happy.
taking care in choosing your guinea pig and its possible companions is the first, and possibly the most important, step in keeping guinea pigs.
make sure your guinea pigs are either of the same sex or neutered/spayed.
health [ edit ]
as prey animals, guinea pigs have evolved to hide any signs of illness, as long as possible in order to avoid becoming the main targets of the dangerous predation.
this can make it difficult to recognize an illness or ailment.
the best way to check for them is to place the cavy carefully on its back and check the belly.
their feet should be clean-looking and not red or irritated; with no broken or extraordinarily long nails.
check their teeth for length and evenness (see section below).
it is also important to check their eyes and nose, to make sure that there is no mucus or crust there.
these are signs of an upper respiratory infection, or uri, and can be deadly if left untreated.
breed [ edit ]
the most common kinds of guinea pig (especially in pet stores) are the short-haired "american" or "self" breed and the "abyssinian", which has curly, cow-licked hair.
long-haired guinea pigs (the sheltie/silky and peruvian breeds) are very beautiful pets, but they need daily grooming to be healthy, thus making them not usually suitable for children.
the hair near the rear of the guinea pig must be cut and cleaned on a regular basis, or it will get caked with feces and the bedding from the cage.
short hair guinea pigs take less effort in the hygienic and cosmetic categories, but still need to be properly cared for.
therefore, the peruvian guinea pig breed is the most difficult breed to care for due to the long hair.
it gets tangled extremely easily, and is not recommended for anyone without extensive time to care for the cavy's hair every day.
how many?
[ edit ]
the vast majority of rescues, knowledgeable vets, household breeders and scientists will tell you that guinea pigs should be housed in groups of two or more.
not only is making sure your guinea pigs have companions important for their health and happiness, keeping multiple guinea pigs will improve the fun of having these animals as pets as you watch them interact.
in practice, the best option is usually a pair of guinea pigs.
of course, the most important factor in choosing groups is to make sure you will not have any unwanted babies, so make sure your pets are either of the same gender or spayed/neutered.
if you are not confident in sexing guinea pigs, buy/adopt whatever guinea pigs you so desire, and then take it to your vet or a cavy-specific rescue to have its gender confirmed before introducing them at all .
a pair of abyssinian guinea pigs
while groups of boars might get along (provided no females are present and they are carefully introduced), and groups of females are often fine, the easiest combination is one neutered boar (neutering is cheaper and safer than spaying) and one or more females.
the personality of individual guinea pigs varies; with some being very amicable to company and others incapable of showing anything but hostility to other cavies.
behavior [ edit ]
guinea pigs are active during the day, but are actually crepuscular (most active at dawn and dusk).
guinea pigs are very gentle, and even untamed guinea pigs will not bite unless you are causing them pain or they have been abused in the past.
guinea pigs have a poor sense of sight, but well-developed senses of hearing and smell.
vocalization is the primary means of communication between members of the species.
wheek - a loud noise that is essentially onomatopoeic, also known as a whistle .
an expression of general excitement, it may occur in response to the presence of its owner or to feeding.
it is sometimes used to find other guinea pigs if they are running.
if a guinea pig is lost, it may wheek for assistance.
listen ( help · info )
bubbling or purring - this sound is made when the guinea pig is enjoying itself, such as when being petted or held.
they may also make this sound when grooming, crawling around to investigate a new place, or when given food.

rumbling - this sound is normally related to dominance within a group, though it can also come as a response to comfort or contentment.
while courting, a male usually purrs deeply, while swaying from side to side and circling the female.

chutting and whining - these are sounds made in pursuit situations, by the pursuer and pursued, respectively.

chirping - this less-common sound seems to be related to stress.
listen ( help · info )
the cage or living environment [ edit ]
while some older guinea pig resources may say that housing them outdoors is acceptable, this is simply not the case.
wind can blow a hutch over easily; it is also the perfect place for molds to grow.
spiders and insects may bite guinea pigs left outside.
there is also no guarantee that temperatures will be acceptable for your guinea pigs to live in.
it is also very hard to notice signs of disease in guinea pigs if they are constantly out of sight, and out of mind.
even indoors, sudden drafts or radical shifts in temperature may adversely affect the health of your guinea pig.
outdoors, guinea pigs may still be subject to predators such as raccoons, opossums, birds of prey and cats.
even a guinea pig physically protected from a predator may suffer from the ill effects of stress from the presence of a predator.
guinea pigs in the andean region of south america are often kept outside on roofs or in milk crates.
but these are livestock, not pets.
a pet guinea pig is a member of your family and will benefit from the most interaction available.
being inside your home will make it easier and more appealing to care for and play with your guinea pig.
additionally, most secure hutches are designed for rabbits, and as such have mostly wood or wire floors that are unsuitable for guinea pigs.
these wire floors are extremely painful for rabbits and cavies alike, and will damage their delicate feet.
indoor housing can consist of a large cage, with a plastic base (not metal mesh, this can damage the guinea pig's feet; wood will soak up urine permanently) and a large metal top half.
as guinea pigs are not climbers, a top is only absolutely necessary if other pets are present in the house.
a pet store cage is nowhere near adequate size for a happy guinea pig, and will cost in upwards of $45–50.
the minimum size cage for 1-2 guinea pigs is 7.5 square feet.
a good cheap option is buying or making a "c&c" cage made of metal mesh cubes (the organizer kind with small plastic connectors, for the outside) and coroplast (the floor and walls) which is basically plastic cardboard you can buy at any sign store for a very low price.
there are instructions at cavy cages
bedding [ edit ]
the housing should be lined with bedding at a minimum of 1 inch deep, ideally deeper in the sleeping areas.
you should never use softwoods such as pine or cedar shavings for bedding, as these emit harmful odors called phenols that cause your guinea pig respiratory problems.
hardwoods such as aspen are fine.
other options for bedding are recycled paper products such as carefresh; these are more expensive, but also stay clean for longer than shavings and are easier on a guinea pig's feet.
a cage needs to be cleaned generally every week at the very minimum, but more often as needed.
a newer form of guinea pig bedding is polar or anti-pill fleece.
while this may seem strange at first, it is a very hygienic and cost-effective form of bedding.
first, an absorbent layer must be in the bottom of the cage, because the function of fleece is to wick the urine away from the guinea pigs' feet.
most fleece users are happy to use 1-2 layers of towels on the bottom of their cage, topped with a single layer of fleece.
so, when a guinea pig urinates on fleece bedding, the urine is wicked through the fleece and into the towels, where it is absorbed.
fleece needs to be washed at least once weekly, without fabric softener; it inhibits the fleece's ability to wick urine.
it is also a good idea to wash it with an unscented detergent, and some white vinegar to absorb odors.
for more information on using fleece as a bedding, please visit [1]
other essential accessories [ edit ]
other items needed for your guinea pig's home will be a gravity-fed water bottle (cavies tend to spill and defecate in water bowls), a small bowl for pellets and other food, and "hidey houses".
wild cavy species and feral guinea pigs naturally use dens made by other animals, and all domestic guinea pigs should be provided a safe place to hide in.
as they are prey animals, they will feel much more secure in their environments if they have places to hide.
this can be a plastic "igloo" or wood house from a pet store, or simply a towel tent.
be aware that some cardboard is put together using glues that can be harmful to your guinea pig, so it is best to avoid these if you can.
if you have more than one guinea pig, having both an entrance and an exit to any hiding places can prevent fights between cornered guinea pigs.
the more hiding places, the merrier!
it is also better for your guinea pigs to keep borders around the cage clear, so that they can run laps.
toys [ edit ]
unlike hamsters or rats, guinea pigs don't need fancy toys such as running balls or exercise wheels.
wheels and balls may have a picture of a guinea pig on the box, but you should not buy one for them to play with.
a cavy's spine (and other bones) is much more fragile than other pet rodents, its feet are too soft, the balls are not properly ventilated for a larger animal such as a cavy.
mostly they like simple things like cardboard shoe boxes, towel tents, oatmeal tubes, paper bags and other tunnels or places to hide and chew on.
some owners give bird toys, but chewing the plastic is very bad for guinea pigs.
mirrors can be hung from outside the cage, however.
an item that is very dangerous and should be avoided is a guinea pig leash.
guinea pigs cannot be trained to walk, and it shouldn't be attempted.
while this may seem like a good way to let them run about the yard safely, it is merely dangerous.
they have very delicate spines and bones, which are easily damaged by a leash or harness.
an alternative way to get fresh air and fresh grass is an outdoor pen, but it should be used when you will be outside with the guinea pig the entire time.
it is good to place their igloo/hut in there with them so if they become startled, they can hide.
the igloo/hut will not suffice for sun protection, however, as it will keep in too much heat.
you must be careful where you place the pen and must stay with the guinea pig at all times while they are outside in it.
also, it should be noted that if a guinea pig is to be outside, the grass it will be on cannot have had any pesticides or fertilizers on it.
these chemicals will kill your guinea pig, and are very dangerous.
food [ edit ]
a guinea pig trio enjoying some dandelion leaves
a guinea pig's diet should be comprised of three basic groups; grass hay, pellets, and fresh treats.
most importantly, a guinea pig cannot make their vitamin c (just like people) and will need it either in vitamin supplements (not droplets, these don't work as the c dissolves too rapidly in water) or in plenty of the right fruits and veggies.
of course, every guinea pig needs a water bottle (they tend to poop in water bowls, and it could get very unhealthy).
pellets
you should give one adult guinea pig approximately 1/8 cup pellets every day, possibly more for young ones.
pellets should be timothy hay-based (little green ones), and not a seed mix.
they can easily choke on seeds, and seeds are too fatty.
alfalfa-based hay pellets have too much calcium, and should not be fed for guinea pigs over 6 months of age.
hay
providing your guinea pig as much timothy hay or orchard grass as it can eat is very important for its health and happiness.
hay provides important digestive fiber and can prevent a condition in older boars where they lose the ability to defecate properly.
also, guinea pigs have a natural inclination to forage for food almost constantly, not giving them proper hay can cause them stress and result in barbering (chewing their own hair) and other behavioral problems.
alfalfa hay can be fed to guinea pigs younger than 6 months, but should not be fed to older guinea pigs other than the occasional treat.
if you do not know the age of your guinea pig, or are unsure, use a different hay that is safe.
fruits and vegetables
if you ever have a question about whether your guinea pig can eat a certain vegetable or fruit, and in which quantities, please visit this link: [2] .
it was made by a guinea pig dietary specialist, and is very helpful!
guinea pigs like to eat lots of green veg, and on the whole this is very good for them, but there are a few things that should be left off your pets menu.
iceberg lettuce causes bloat and gas, and so should be avoided, no exception.
tomato leaves are also not good for piggies.
carrot in excess can cause liver problems due to the excessive amounts of vitamin a, and in the pregnant cavy can cause birth defects.
however, in small amounts to a non pregnant guinea pig, this is fine.
mushrooms and rhubarb are poisonous.
the best fruits and veggies for vitamin c are romaine lettuce, carrot, kale, mustard greens, red bell pepper, spinach and many others.
oddly, oranges do not have very much vitamin c and can even cause the runs in guinea pigs.
they need 10-20 mg of vitamin c a day if they are healthy.
if they are unhealthy, pregnant, or under 3 months, they should get 30-50 mg.
for additional vitamin c, you can purchase vitamin c tablets.
it is very important that you do not use vitamin c drops, as these can result in dehydration in guinea pigs.
do not give them multivitamins.
these can be bad for them and even poisonous.
other things to avoid
mixes or treats with nuts, seeds, dried fruit and dyed pieces.
dairy and meat products (cavies are herbivores)
seeds in husks can be a choking hazard.
cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, collards, bok choy, broccoli) may cause gas in your pet and are best offered sparingly and infrequently.
mineral wheels.
never use tang (which contains dyes, refined sugars, and very little vitamin c) in drinking water.
commercial treats marketed for cavies (like yogurt drops) which can even be detrimental to their health.
consuming these empty calories (many contain fat, sugars and even excess calcium) can result in decreased consumption of the basic foods they really need.
guinea pigs are very strictly herbivores; therefore, they are lactose intolerant.
yogurt and honey are not good for guinea pigs, and should be avoided.
problems [ edit ]
before you bringing home your new guinea pig, you should locate your nearest veterinarian, and go in to the practice to pick up any leaflets or advice sheets on basic first aid for guineas.
staff should be knowledgeable, and will be able to help you with any other queries you might have about your guinea pigs.
make sure to visit a knowledgeable exotic pet veterinarian, as many regular cat and dog veterinarians have limited knowledge of cavies and some may refuse to treat them altogether.
pain as guinea pigs are naturally prey animals, they instinctively hide pain to prevent appearing as a weak animal within the group.
as a result it may be difficult to tell if they are hurting.
if you notice changes in behavior, or unusual avoidance of handling, call your veterinarian for advice.
parasites guinea pigs can occasionally harbor skin (ecto-) parasites, which may not always be visible to the naked eye.
fortunately these parasites are not zoonotic, meaning your guinea pig cannot give them to you.
treatment with a topical product called revolution(r) (active ingredient, selamectin) is a very effective method of controlling ectoparasites.

a bushel of crabs is how many pounds?
a bushel and a pound are two different measurements!
while both are generally dry units of measurements the bushel is used mostly in agriculture.
a bushel of wheat and a … bushel of corn have two different weights as do apples and oranges, where as a pound is a pound.
the only way you're going to figure out the weight of a bushel of crabs is to cram as many crabs into a bushel basket as you can (good luck with that) and weigh it.
then again it depends on the type of crabs as well.

how many ounces is a bushel?
it depends on the material being measured.
bushel is volume measurement while ounces is a weight measurement.
if you know the commodity being measured, you can then figure out … the ounces.
for example, dry shelled field corn is 56 pounds per bushel.
take that multiplied by 16 ounces per pound and you can say that for corn, a bushel is 896 ounces.

truth is knowledge of things as they really are, as they really were and as they really will be.
anti-virus software is intended to detect and protect computer systems against the types of malware known as viruses and worms.
the better ones will attempt to repair systems that are infected and delete the malware when possible and at least quarantine it where it cannot execute if it is impossible to clean it up.
a worm is a piece of malware that propagates itsself across the network without the user doing anything.
a virus generally does something bad to the computer when the user executes it.
the virus may be a stand-alone piece of software or attached to another program (also known as a "trojan horse").
the anti-spyware does this either by recognizing a "signature" for the virus - a piece of code that is unique to the virus, or by heuristic methods - looking at the behavior of the software to detect it doing things that are typical of viruses.
anti-virus software does not protect against spam, spyware, or adware although many antivirus programs have integrated anti-spyware and anti-adware functionality into their products.

how is antivirus software used to protect against computer threats?
anti-virus software typically uses two different techniques to accomplish this:examining files to look for known viruses by means of a virus dictionaryidentifying suspicious b … ehavior from any computer program which might indicate infection most commercial anti-virus software uses both of these approaches, with an emphasis on the virus dictionary approach.
although the dictionary approach is considered effective, virus authors have tried to stay a step ahead of such software by writing "polymorphic viruses", which encrypt parts of themselves or otherwise modify themselves as a method of disguise, so as to not match the virus's signature in the dictionary.

responsibilities of a babysitter babysitter responsibilities vary widely from job to job depending on the age of the children, their specific needs and the particular requirements set by the parents.
for younger children, responsibilities may include diaper changes, feeding, and holding; on the other hand, babysitting older children may involve driving them to soccer practice or helping them with their homework.
while some children are nearly self-sufficient, all will have certain needs.
this could include anything from fixing them a snack to helping them with a physical disability.
circumstances that may surround the job, such as the parents going away on business or the children wanting to take a trip to the museum, may require you to take on heavier responsibilities such as staying overnight or driving.
specific expectations of the parents will also determine what you will have to do as a babysitter.
for example, some parents want their children in bed at a certain time.
in this case, you need to make sure that they change into pajamas and brush their teeth before that time comes.
the best way to determine the responsibilities you will have as a babysitter is ask parents directly.

how do you become a babysitter?
have your parents let their friends know that you are interested.
have your pastor let people at your church know that you are  interested.
have your teacher let anyone he … or she knows that you  are interested.
or even put up a flier at some of the grocery stores.
for example:  "hi, my name is jane, i'm 14, very responsible, and looking for  babysitting work.
i've the best rates in town!"
soon you'll have a few clients.
hopefully then, you'll do such a  good job that you'll get recommendations.
also, if any of your friends are already babysitting, offer to fill  in for one of them if they need an evening off.
anything to get you  started!
can you be a babysitter?
well of course is you are old enough.
here are some tips.
1.
arrive a few minutes early. 2.ask for emergency information, important phone numbers and directions to the house a … s soon as you arrive. 3.include the full names of children and parents and any necessary medical information about the children. 4.meet the family dog. 5.walk through the house and do a safety check. 6.interact with the children.
when you are playing with the children, you will have them in your sight, and they will be too busy to get hurt or in trouble.

can a child be a babysitter?
no.
a babysitter needs to be a trustworthy, responsible, attentive, intelligent teenager or adult, preferably with a driver's license in case of emergency.
they have to be tru … sted to answer the phone and not tell a total stranger that the head of the house is not around, and they need to be able to answer the door wisely and responsibly.
a child would simply be in too much danger as a babysitter.
even if they know all the rules, accidents do happen, and i don't know about you, but if i had a child, i would want my babysitter to be able to drive my child to the hospital.
also, if you're thinking about dinner, a child can use a microwave, sure, but they can burn themselves, and heaven forbid a child should have access to a stove or an oven.
a responsible adult will be able to make a wholesome dinner for the child, or at least be old enough to order pizza.
so no; a child most definitely cannot be a babysitter.

what does a babysitter have to do?
well, a babysitter must be a responsible teenager or adult.
the babysitter should be able to take care of the children, put them to sleep, change their diapers, get them to st … ay in their freaking beds and not come out every five seconds...
knowing cpr and the heimlich maneuver is probably a good idea.
knowing the parents' numbers and emergency numbers are probably more important.
when the kids are asleep, take advantage of the house's tv and computer (only if you asked permission!)
feel free to eat their food.
as to getting paid?
don't let yourself be taken advantage of.
you should be paid 7-10 dollars an hour.
more if the kids are under two.

you get moles by how the melanin in your skin is transported throughout your body.
in some cases, the melanin can create small clusters in your skin, known as the mole.
in rare cases, a mole can be cancerous but moles can disappear as you age.
there is no known reason as to why moles are formed or their purpose.

how long does opiates stay in blood?
although i wouldn't worry about blood drug tests, unless you're planning on having a tox screen run on you at the hospital, in which case, you probably won't face too ma … ny consequences other than a hospital bill for relevant problems.
opiates will stay in urine for 1-7 days, depending on your size and the amount/frequency of use.
however, they will remain at detectable levels in your blood for up to 20 days, again, depending on the volume, frequency, and your size.

how long does it take for opiates to get out of your system to pass a drug test?
opiates tend to flush out of your system in 2-5 days depending on  how much water you drink, how much you weigh, how much you were  using.
opiates such as oxycontin tend to … stay in your system for a  day or 2 longer than other opiates such as heroin and codine  (vicodin).
if you drink 2 gallons of water in one day you will  completely flush all opiates in your system.
answer:   2 to 4 days.
i would not count on the two gallon therapy described  above, there is no evidence that this has worked or will work to  pass a drug test.
it will not help in the case of a hair test.

how long does it take for opiates to flush out of your system?
you will need 30 days.
in this time it will be cleaned from your system.
you must not have any drugs during this time to be clean.
(this is entirely false.)
correct answer is … as follows: depending on you metabolism, weight and how active you are it can take anywhere from 18 hours to 5 days.
the average person will be clean in about 2-3 days.
opiates are cleansed at a much faster pace than toxins such as thc due to the fact that opiates are not metabolized within the fat cells.
in other words opiate toxins are briefly stored in a liquid form only via blood, sweat, tears, urine(most commonly tested), and saliva.
therefore one simple flush of all liquid entities within the body will permanently rid it of any and all opiates toxins.
how long does it take to get opiates out of the system with water?
opiates are detectable in the urine for 8-24 hours.
they are  detectable in the saliva up to 1-2 days.
however, they can be  detected by hair sample for up to 90 days.

hello kitty (1974) [ edit ]
main article: hello kitty
hello kitty ( ハローキティ , harō kiti ) is the best-known of sanrio's fictional characters , created in 1974.
hello kitty is drawn simply with a trademark red bow.
registered in 1975, [2] hello kitty is now a globally known trademark .
hello kitty has been marketed in the united states from the beginning and has held the position of u.s. children's ambassador for unicef since 1983.
the brand rose to greater prominence during the late 1990s when several celebrities such as mariah carey adopted hello kitty as a fashion statement.
new products featuring the character can be found in virtually any american department store and hello kitty was once featured in an advertising campaign of the retail chain target .
the character got its first massively multiplayer online game produced by sanrio digital and typhoon games entitled hello kitty online which was released worldwide, including the united states, singapore , indonesia and the philippines .
a cheerful and happy girl with a heart of gold, hello kitty can bake delicious cookies, but she loves mama’s apple pie even more.
her favourite hobbies include travelling, music, reading, and making new friends.
her best friend is her twin sister mimmy.
hello kitty was born on november 1 in the suburbs of london , united kingdom .
her real name is kitty white ( キティ・ホワイト , kiti howaito ) .
kitty has a twin sister named mimmy, who is a little shy and very girly.
she is very different from kitty because she wears her ribbon on her right ear opposite of her sister.
her bow is yellow, while kitty's is red.
mimmy also wears blue overalls, similar to kitty's red overalls.
in 2010, to celebrate sanrio's 50th anniversary, hello kitty was also sold as a plush toy at build-a-bear workshop stores, along with several other sanrio characters.
my melody (1975) [ edit ]
see also: onegai my melody
my melody is a little girl rabbit who always wears a red or pink hood that also covers her ears.
her birthday is january 18.
like hello kitty, my melody is rather popular in asia and can be found on children's toys and merchandise.
my melody was first released in 1975 and the first related merchandise was released at the end of that year.
at first she was mostly marketed toward young girls, but like hello kitty her popularity has increased within women of all ages, especially in asia .
according to the new york times , this character is "moderately successful" in terms of popularity but shows no signs of reaching the global popularity of hello kitty.
[3]
my melody's popularity waned toward the late 1980s, and the only goods produced were stationery and candy.
according to a reader survey published in strawberry news (a magazine published by sanrio) in 1996, my melody came out amongst some of sanrio's most popular characters and as a result, due to popular demand, standard merchandise started re-appearing beginning in february 1997 featuring the original red hood.
goods with the pink hood were re-released in 1999 and as of 2000 there were goods released with multiple color hoods.
my melody has been turned into a pullip doll, like two other sanrio characters, hello kitty and cinnamoroll .
the doll includes a toy of flat the mouse.
on april 3, 2005, an anime series based on my melody and her friends and produced by studio comet started to air on tv osaka and tv tokyo television stations, called onegai my melody (おねがいマイメロディ), which aired from 2005 to 2008.
this anime also spawned a video game for the nintendo ds titled onegai my melody: yume no kuni no daibouken (おねがいマイメロディ～夢の国の大冒険～).
the game relies heavily on a feature of the nintendo ds console which requires the player to blow air into the microphone of the unit.
the player guides my melody through timed levels by jumping and using her umbrella to float around and avoid enemies.
the game also features unlockable content as well, such as music, images, and mini-games.
currently, sanrio has no plans to release this series in north america .
my melody also appears in the sanrio digital and dream cortex series, the adventures of hello kitty & friends .
she, however, is mouthless there, and her rival doesn't make an appearance.
in 2007, a second game was released for the nintendo ds titled my melody angel book ~denshitechou & enjoy game~ (マイメロディエンジェルブック～電子手帳＆エンジョイゲーム～).
the game's primary function is as a day planner designed for young girls to keep track of appointments, class schedules, and mini diary entries.
on march 1, 2008, mattel released a barbie doll named "my melody".
the my melody barbie doll featured a barbie doll inspired by the my melody character, with the character's face included in different parts of the doll's fashion and accessories.
in an homage to the character's rabbit ears, the doll's hair is styled in pigtails.
[4]
on march 26, 2008, a japanese music compilation album titled "i love 30 - my melody" from tearbridge records was released with my melody wearing the original red hood drawn in various artwork styles by groovisions.
she is voiced by rei sakuma in the anime.
in october 2010, she was sold as a plush toy at build-a-bear workshop stores to celebrate sanrio's 50th anniversary, along with other sanrio characters.
in 2014, sanrio celebrated the character's 40th anniversary by creating a special line of merchandise where she is given a different hood where her ears are dropped down and wears either a bonnet or a flower pin and sometimes depicted with eyelashes.
sanrio puroland honored the 40th anniversary of the character by creating indoor ride called "my melody drive" where visitors are visiting maryland and encounter my melody and her friends including kuromi who attempts to ruin her day.
little twin stars (1975) [ edit ]
little twin stars are a pair of angel-like characters.
the younger brother is kiki, and the older sister is lala.
kiki has blue hair, while lala has pink hair (sometimes kiki's hair is brown while lala's hair is blonde).
they were introduced in 1975 and enjoyed popularity in the early 1980s.
their birthday is december 24 (christmas eve).
the characters make cameo appearances in 2004 on the front cover of tommy february6 's second album tommy airline and in her video for the song "magic in your eyes", and in one of the sanrio unico movies.
in 2014, sanrio did a crossover with american greetings ' care bears characters, creating merchandise that features the care bears interacting with kiki and lala.
the merchandise was called "care bears x the little twin stars" and was exclusive to japan.
in 2015, eva air introduced a special livery boeing 777-300er , "shining stars", dedicated to the characters.

it's important to do your homework before purchasing a big screen television.
there's a lot of junk out there that might save pennies up front, but ultimately ends up biting you in the back side with its lack of durability, lesser quality and other problems.
however, before considering what brand to buy, you should first determine what kind of big screen tv you're looking for.
lcd (liquid crystal display) tv
advantages
lcds are good for still images and make good computer monitors.
so, if you're looking for a screen for tv and computer use, lcds are a good bet
quality lcds have excellent brightness level pictures.
lcd flat panels don't take up room and can be mounted on walls.
in addition, lcds are typically slightly lighter than plasma tvs.
quality lcds have a fairly long life, especially compared to older models (roughly 13-15 years at a six-hour per day pace.
disadvantages
lcds are not good for fast-moving pictures.
when an object moves quickly across the screen, the image "delays" (there are trails of pixilation or blockingess), because the screen can't keep up.
for this reason, lcds that are 37" or smaller generally have better image quality because the delay is less noticeable than on larger lcds.
lcd tvs have difficulty with black levels
lcd image looks great when you're staring directly at it, but if you are watching from a slanted view the quality of the image can diminish greatly.
lcds are very expensive over 35"
lcds sometimes have pixel failure.
this isn't a common problem with top name brands, where one or two pixels might eventually die, leaving a black dot here and there.
this is hardly noticeable unless you're standing directly in front of the screen (considering a 20" lcd screen has 30,000 pixels).
however, in cheaper models where 10% of the pixels could go out, the tv may become unwatchable.
plasma tv
advantages
top name brand plasmas have a fairly long life, lasting about 20 years at a six hours per day pace.
a plasma screen has a field vision of about 180 degrees without loss of picture quality.
that means you can watch the screen from any angle.
plasmas are very bright (about 4-5 times brighter than the average tv)
they have great contrast ratios (enables them to show better shadow detail)
plasmas are generally cheaper than lcds
they have excellent picture response.
there is virtually no delay (blockiness or pixilation) like with lcds.
doesn't take up much space and can be mounted on a wall.
disadvantages
plasmas can have burn in problems.
plasmas do not make as good computer monitors as lcds.
if you were to leave the plasma tv on for 24 hours a day and there was an image that remained constant on the screen (like a logo), you would run the risk of that image permanently burning into the screen.
however, the chance of this happening is often over-exaggerated.
plasmas are not available below 37 inches.
dlp (digital light processing) tv
advantages
dlp screens are larger and are cheaper in the short-term than lcd or plasma.
good brightness and color.
dlp can illuminate a larger screen for more people at a cheaper initial cost than plasma.
disadvantages
there's a high maintanence cost.
the dlp tv is basically a video projector in a box.
you have to replace the lightbulb, which has limited durability.
dlps take up a lot more space than plasma and lcd and are not wall mountable.
dlps don't have as good field vision as plasmas, meaning you can't get as good picture quality when viewing the screen at an angle.
dlps are not known for having that great of picture quality.
fast moving objects can cause a trail of colors (color artifacts).

best answer: biologically your body has to be ready, normally about 12 to 16 years old.
next sex has to be legal, in uk this is 16 years old.
next a baby needs both parents so you need to be in stable ( preferably married) relationship.
minimum age early to mid twenties for girls, a bit later for boys.
next babies cost a lot of money so you need to be financially stable and mature.
you dont need to be on rocket scientist salary but you do need to be able to sensibly manage the money you have .
there are many other factors but try not to think about it before 25.

a few years ago the youngest recorded mother was just eight years old (obviously this is extremely rare and is a world record).

how tall is a horse that is 15.3 hands?
well one hand is about 4 inches.
so 15.3 hands would be 61 and a bit inches.
if you are looking at buying a horse that is 15.3 inches tall you should be able to see over the h … orse's back and your legs should game down to at least half way down its side.
your feet shouldn't hang below it's stomach.

is 16 hands tall for a horse?
depends on what you consider tall. 16 hands is about 5 ft 4 in. (horses are measured at the withers.)
personally, i think it is tall, my gelding is 15-2 and i don't think he i … s tall.
and 16 is just two more inches.
if you have long legs, it won't be a problem.

how tall is 19 hand horse in feet?
19 hands is measured from the withers,or the horses shoulders.
each 'hand' is 4".
so 19 hands would be 19 x 4=76" and divided by 12" is roughly 6'3" at the shoulder.

how many hands tall is a horse?
at 14.2 hh a pony becomes a horse.
so from 14.2hh up the equine is considered 'horse'.
some of the biggest horses can reach 19 or 20 hh.
that's a pretty big horse.

how tall is a 14.3 hands horse?
one hand is 4 inches or 10.16 centimeters. which makes a 14.3hh horse 59 inches tall at the withers or 1.4986 meters or 149.86 centimeters tall.

porfirio diaz was born on the 15th of september 1830 at soledad inn, oaxaca.
his father faustino diaz died when he was three years old.
ever since his first years of life, porfirio diaz got accustomed to living at the inn with the traveling soldiers and all classes of merchants, peddlers.
almost four years after his fathers death, the family had to sell the inn.
his family moved to one of the houses they had inherited on the other side of the city, called la toronja.
porfirio became a carpenters apprentice and started learning his first sentences and letters at la amiga, a type of school where a lady taught children in exchange of a modest tuition.
when he turned six, he was sent to the public school of first letters and shared the classroom with a first generation of students born after the independence.
there were up to 150 students per classroom.
at fifteen he was sent to a seminary.
it wasnt an exceptional decision; the church was the only way a humble family could provide children with a good education.
his enrollment was eased by his uncle and godfather, canon josé agustín domínguez, a man of certain strength and prestige in the region.
the family made a deal: domínguez would finance porfirios studies and promised to make him a chaplain on the condition that he studied at the conciliatory seminary of oaxaca and became a priest.
during his adolescence there was effervescence in politics about territorial problems, the loss of most of the countrys north and the territorial aspirations of other nations.
the students of oaxaca, at the request of the seminarys leaders, officially offered their services to the state governor, forming a national guard battalion called trujano, which logically, being a reserve and operating in a zone invaders in no way reached, never went out into the battlefield.
during this time he met benito juarez and started to get involved in the social and political problems of the era.
therefore, upon finishing school he had the conviction that his future was not in a cassock, but rather in military uniform.
he then studied some more and enrolled in the army, in which he quickly became outstanding.
in 1876, protesting against the reelection of benito juarez and lerdo de tejada, general porfirio diaz promoted their destitution, according to the plan de la noria, and became president.
mexico no longer had, until 1911, another governor other than this anti-reelection general, who after coming into power repeatedly amended the constitution of 1857 for remaining indefinitely, reelecting himself eleven times.
porfirio diaz came to power as president with a group of military men in charge of the government, giving preference to the military over civilians, because they better served his interest.
during his first presidential period, he proved his ideas of liberty and prosperity.
the first task of his mandate was to achieve the countrys peace, which was going through continuous revolts, as the one of tuxtepec, where the old and new liberals disputed power.
based on order, not freedom, was diazs first hidden goal, provisionally becoming president on the 15th of february, 1877.
he became constitutional president on the 5th of may.
he entered with the purpose of being a man of sticks and command.
he especially desired to establish order and discipline, while winning the support of aristocrats.
between 1877 and 1880, he didnt know how to handle his cabinet.
he often appointed and removed ministers.
for six state ministries, he used 22 ministers in less than four years.
he had seven secretaries of finance, for example.
after this first period, he started planning to the presidency in the hands of his friend manuel gonzález.
peacefully, manuel gonzález became president on december 1st 1880, which he would later regain.
again as president, porfirio diaz turned mexico into a great country imitating european trends, with great investments in communications and oil, henequen and mining enterprises.
one of the most criticized and often recognized acts of diaz has been the contrast of the country he attempted; on the one hand there was an investment flow like never before, exports had increased more than ever, he had given order and peace to a country after a xix century full of struggles and economic chaos.
however, in exchange for this flow from foreign investors, mexicos lower class, such as the workers, farmers, miners, peasants, and others, had sunk into poverty.
it was a type of deal between diaz and foreigners, as the people who handled private economy.
he assured almost free labor, in exchange for a prosperous country.
diaz allowed the municipal and state chiefs of the whole country to capture people as slaves, who they kidnapped and forced to work in the great henequen fields, oil wells and mines.
they had to sign contracts that tied them for life.
this system was called to hook and didnt do anything other than offer free labor to the producers of oil, henequen and great industrialists.
hundreds of trains traveled throughout the country transporting peasants and natives from one place to another, where they were sold by policemen or people specialized in their capture and transport.
they lived on only one daily ration of food consisting of atole, one tortilla, dough or a beverage to keep them awake.
on the other hand, the topic of prosperity, the country had a train system that was a great advantage for industrialization, an infrastructure permitting and increase of exports; but gave priority to part of the population; the rest lived in extreme poverty.
in the process of henequen, oil and other industries, businessmen made a deal with diaz to provide labor, which as has been mentioned, was slavery.
laborers were hired and increased their daily debt to the local store, until literally owing their life, which they had to pay with 16 hours of work and one meal per day, and forced labor; decreasing the population at work centers like mines, fields and wells.
the north was a great provider of seris, yaquis and other natives, captured within their own reserves, transported by train to regions as far as the henequen fields of yucatan and the chiapas jungle for processing rubber.
additionally, they had already suffered under porfirio the plundering of their lands, sometimes as expropriation and others by a simple presidential decree.
in places with mining wealth, the population was excluded and the reserves were taken.
yaqui indians suffered many humiliations during porfirios era, even being exterminated by persecution and plundering policies carried out against them.
mexico became an apparently prosperous nation but lacking political freedom, although there were periodic false elections with electoral frauds; with social justice, but in truth the gross of the population lacked rights, the small rural landowners had their land stolen in benefit of large estates; with also a strong dependency on foreign investment.
besides the poverty status, some circumstances prompted the revolution, some landowners that for long had been benefited by official dispositions, had their interests affected when part of their estates were expropriated, especially in the countrys north.
the estates of the north were different than those from the south because they had been assembled by military or wealthy men, or even farmers that once had the opportunity to prosper, therefore, they didnt mistreat their workers.
during expropriations they handed over the rights of commercial exploitation, landowners and workers were against the government, and in the south, farmers had the opportunity to recover the lands rights.
porfirio diaz had been allowing the opposition, knowing it wasnt threatening, and stating to journalist creelman that mexico was prepared to choose its political route, inferring he would leave power.
the moment was right, thousands were dissatisfied, the economy was affected by a decrease in exports and liberal opposition groups presented their candidates for the following presidential election, but when the elections were invalidated and diaz was again self-proclaimed president, he provoked the mexican revolution, with the fall of juarez city in the hands of villas troops, obligating him to quit his attempt and go into exile in paris on the 2nd of july, 1915.
